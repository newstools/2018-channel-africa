The draft text, a copy of which was obtained by AFP, would renew the MONUSCO force's mandate for a year and outline its priorities as the DRC heads for historic elections on December 23. The elections in the vast mineral-rich African country are to pave the way for a transfer of power from President Joseph Kabila, who took over from his father after he was assassinated in 2001. Kinshasa authorities have set a date for the vote but Kabila has not clearly stated whether he will step aside, raising fears that the country will slide into all-out violence. The draft resolution "underscores the need to do everything possible to ensure that the elections on 23 December 2018 are organised with the requisite conditions of transparency, credibility and inclusivity and security." It would task MONUSCO with protecting civilians and with supporting the electoral process, including the registration of voters, the vote and a transfer of power on January 12. The measure requests that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres make plans for beefing up the peacekeeping mission if needed, "looking at all options" such as sending reinforcements from other missions, according to the text. Guterres would report to the council 90 days after the adoption of the resolution on the contingency planning. The council is scheduled to vote on the draft resolution on March 27, and diplomats said they expected it to be adopted. --AFP--
