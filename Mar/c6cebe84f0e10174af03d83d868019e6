While some have called for Melbourne to be a night race, especially to benefit European television viewers, the CEO of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, Andrew Westacott, said the only minor adjustment to the timing was a 10-minute later start to the race which organisers Liberty Media have said will help broadcasters that start their programming at the top of the hour produce a better product. This ten minutes past the hour start will be used in every race this season. Fans are also eager to see what Formula One and the first race of the season has in store for them over the weekend. Mercedes' driver Lewis Hamilton begins the defence of his title on Sunday, with the race starting at 0510GMT. --reuters--
