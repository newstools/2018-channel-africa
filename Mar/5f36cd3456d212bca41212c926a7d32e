Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City had lodged a protest with the PSL arguing that Ajax Cape Town had contravened FIFA rules by fielding the player. The player played for Pirates before signing for a Saudi Arabia side Al Faisaly before returning to the Absa Premiership to join Ajax. FIFA rules prohibit a player to play for three different clubs in a single season. In his ruling on Wednesday, March 28, Cassim referred the case to FIFA saying it was because the matter involved an overseas/international club. He also ruled that in the meantime, the player should stop playing for Ajax. --News24--
