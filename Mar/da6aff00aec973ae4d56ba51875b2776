Chasing a rain-reduced total of 230 in 40 overs at the Harare Sports Club, Zimbabwe could only manage 226 for seven despite a run-a-ball 80 from Sean Williams. The defeat left them with the slimmest of chances of joining West Indies as qualifiers for the 10-team tournament. Host, England, and the top seven other teams in the ICC ODI Championship on September 30 last year automatically made the cut for the 2019 event. The winner of the final Super Six fixture between Ireland and Afghanistan will reach the global showpiece. If Friday’s fixture is a washout, Ireland will qualify for next year’s finals.  “It’s a big win for us, beating a test team. No one knew about us, now they’ll know about us,” UAE Captain Rohan Mustafa said. “I feel sorry for Zimbabwe but that’s sport.” --Reuters--
