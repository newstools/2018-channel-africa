The Olympic gold medalist stopped the clock in 4:02.50, just 0.70 seconds off the record set by Budd (4:01.80) in Port Elizabeth in 1984. Sadly not for the first time in South African athletics, there was some controversy with the stadium clock showing Semenya had finished in 3:57, well inside the record. However, official timekeepers confirmed that she had just missed out and that the stadium clock was incorrect. Semenya was followed home by Dominique Scott-Efurd (4:08.61) and Zani Kruger (4:23.61). Earlier, Luxolo Adams won the 200 metres in 20.01, his personal best time. He beat the more fancied Anaso Jobodwana who came second in 20.07. Carina Horn won the women's 100 metres in a time of 11.12, not as fast as her times earlier this season, but impressive nonetheless. Akani Simbine won the men's 100m in 10.08. --News24--
