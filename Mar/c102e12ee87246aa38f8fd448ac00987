“Macro-economic performance continued to be strong in 2017. Economic growth is estimated to have exceeded 5.0%,” International Monetary Fund (IMF) Mission Chief Amadou Sy said in a statement issued on Tuesday. It said inflation in the Indian Ocean country reached 3.5% by the end of 2017. Inflation in the Seychelles rose to 4.88% year-on-year in February from 4.5% a month earlier. IMF said Seychelles’ economy outlook for 2018 remained positive but added it was still vulnerable to external factors that could affect tourism. --Reuters--
