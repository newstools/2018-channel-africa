The China Medical case is the most high-profile and closely watched contest in years over the production of Chinese audit work papers, an issue that has put Hong Kong and US regulators at loggerheads with China - and at one point threatened to leave US-listed Chinese firms unaudited and in danger of delisting. In a previously unreported ruling made last week, Hong Kong’s High Court rejected a KPMG procedural request that would limit the time in which China Medical liquidators can pursue claims against KPMG for losses and damages for its audits of the now-defunct company. The ruling also paves the way for proceedings on a contempt summons brought against 91 KPMG partners and former partners issued in November for refusal to comply with a High Court order to produce China Medical’s audit work papers. A substantive hearing on that action is widely expected later this year. KPMG and mainland associate KPMG Huazhen have refused to comply with a 2016 Hong Kong High Court order to provide copies of audit work papers to Borrelli Walsh Ltd, China Medical’s liquidator, arguing it would violate China’s national security laws. Deputy High Court Judge Anthony To, in last week’s decision, wrote that KPMG’s refusal to hand over the papers made it "extremely difficult" for liquidators "to determine whether or not to commence proceedings against KPMG". KPMG in Hong Kong that signed off the audits has claimed it does not have the papers. KPMG Huazhen has allowed liquidators to examine some of China Medical’s papers on site under the supervision of the auditor’s personnel and attorneys, a situation Judge To characterised as "unworkable".
