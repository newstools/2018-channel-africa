Zuma was addressing thousands of congregants at eThekwini Community Church in Durban in the Passover service. Zuma says even after he had left the position of being the President, he is still followed. The former head of state also says he is facing endless prosecution. Zuma is expected to appear in the Durban High Court on eighteen charges of fraud related charges. It is the first time that he has spoken out since his corruption charges were reinstated. The former President will appear alongside Thint Holding Company on charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering. A company owned by Zuma's former advisor Shabir Shaik, Nkobi Group was allegedly used to solicit a bribe on behalf of Zuma when he was still the Deputy President. Between October 1995 and July 2005 Shaik's company allegedly made 783 payments to Zuma. The state alleges that Zuma used his position in government to help Shaik in his business dealings in exchange of bribes Shaik was allegedly soliciting for the former President.
