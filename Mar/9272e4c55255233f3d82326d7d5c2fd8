Media reports from France indicate that Meyer will head up the coaching ranks at the Parisian club in the 2018/19 season. According to the RMC Sport website, Meyer has signed a three-year contract with Stade Francais, while the Rugby Rama website and rugby publication Midi Olympique are reporting that Meyer will become the clubâ€™s director of rugby, replacing New Zealander Greg Cooper who vacated his post in January due to personal reasons. This comes after a report surfaced in January that Meyer was in high demand in France and England. Sport24 on Thursday contacted Meyer for comment on the matter, but he is yet to respond. The former Bulls mentor is the current managing director of Carinat Sports Marketing and recently also made headlines for launching the World Schools Festival which takes place in Paarl between April 2-7, 2018. The international event, which will feature the top 10 schools in South Africa and 10 of the best school teams from around the world, will be hosted by Paarl Boys' High School as part of the institution's 150-year anniversary celebrations. Meyer coached the Springboks between 2012 and 2015. During his tenure the Boks played 48 Tests, winning 32, losing 14 with two draws (67% win record). --news24--
