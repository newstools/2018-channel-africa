Authorities say Zimbabwe lost at least $1.4 billion in revenue as a result. When Mnangagwa took over as president in November following Mugabe's ouster, he issued a three-month ultimatum urging those who had illegally taken money out of the country to either bring it back or account for it. "Despite concerted efforts by authorities and banks to request these entities and individuals to account for the externalised funds, the entities or individuals failed, ignored or neglected to respond to the amnesty," he said in a statement. He also released a list of 1 403 offenders. The authorities have no other recourse but to cause these entities and individuals to respond and, where necessary, to ensure that those responsible for such illicit flows are brought to justice." The deadline saw $591 million being returned while another $826 million remained outstanding, officials said.  --News24--
