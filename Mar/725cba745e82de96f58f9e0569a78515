WFP and its partners under the leadership of the Nigerian government says it has managed to stave off famine in three conflict affected north-eastern states by helping displaced families and host communities access plots of land, irrigation and training. The United Nations estimates that almost 1 million people are in hard-to-reach parts of the northeast, where Islamist group Boko Haram has waged an insurgency for the past nine years. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) recently said there was "an elevated risk of famine" in that area. The insurgency has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million others, many of whom are almost entirely dependent on international aid. Fatmata Ahmad, a widow with six children whose husband was killed 18 months ago by Boko Haram suspects says she looks better than she was months ago. This new report is coming about two weeks after Boko Haram suspects raided a military barracks in Rann, in Borno state killing 11 people including three aid workers. However, the WFP says it urgently needs US$ 94 million to continue life-saving food and nutrition assistance to families until the end of 2018, especially for remote places which will be cut-off during the rainy season from June through September. --reuters--
