Young Somali men stand nearby, some disapproving but all watching closely, as the women jog up and down, dribble a worn-out ball between colourful cones and do sit-ups, less than 200 metres from a heavily guarded security checkpoint. The sight of young women playing football is highly unusual in Somalia, due to societal pressures as well as fear of Al-Shabaab. The Al-Qaeda linked Islamist group launches regular attacks in Mogadishu and considers forms of entertainment, such as football, to be evil, worse if women are involved. "It is obvious that we are scared despite the fact that we put on heavy clothes over our shorts and T-shirts until we get to the pitch. It is very difficult to walk normally with sports clothes we never wear sports clothing in society," said Hibaq Abdukadir, 20, one of the footballers. She is among 60 girls, who have signed up to train at the Golden Girls Centre in Mogadishu, Somalia's first female soccer club. Mohamed Abukar Ali, the 28-year-old co-founder of the centre, said he was inspired to create the club after he realised that Somalia had no female footballers.Â  "We are trying to make these girls the first Somali female football professionals," he said. However this is not an easy task. "When the girls have to attend training sessions, we have to organise to pick them up and bring them here and back home after the session because they are girls and we think about their security," said Ali. "There are so many challenges, from security to lack of resources..but that will not deter our ambition to establish female football clubs in this country," he said. "We believe it is the right time and we should have the courage to think differently." Many of the girls who have joined the club said they had always wanted to try playing football but never had the opportunity.  --AFP--
