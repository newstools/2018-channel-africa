Speaking after just winning a new six-year term in office from 2018-2024, Putin said he regarded a question about whether he would seek yet another term in six years' time as "funny." "Let's count, will I be sitting here (in power) until I'm 100 years old? No! no!" he told the reporter who asked him the question. Putin also said he did not plan any constitutional reforms for now and any changes in the Russian government would only take place after his inauguration. Putin won a landslide re-election victory on Sunday, extending his rule over the world's largest country for another six years at a time when his ties with the West are on a hostile trajectory. --Reuters--
