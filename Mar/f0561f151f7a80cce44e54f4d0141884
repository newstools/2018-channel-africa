At the 2017 Melbourne race, Bottas finished third and said he was hoping for a stronger finish. He added that there were still a lot of question marks with how the cars and tyres would perform in Melbourne. The 28-year-old has no certainty beyond 2018, with rivals already eyeing up one of the sport's most coveted seats. Bottas said he needed to step up his game and do his best every time he's on the track. The driver joined Mercedes in January 2017, after the sudden retirement of world champion Nico Rosberg. --Reuters--
