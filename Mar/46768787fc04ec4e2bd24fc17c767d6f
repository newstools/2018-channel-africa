The Indian Ocean island economy expanded by 3.8% in 2017, lower than the previous estimate of 3.9%. Statistics Mauritius said agriculture would expand by 1.1% this year instead of 2.0%, due to no growth in sugarcane and lower growth in other agricultural activities. Mauritius, which markets itself as a bridge between Africa and Asia, has been working to shift the economy from reliance on sugar, textiles and tourism towards offshore banking, business outsourcing, luxury real estate and medical tourism. --Reuters--
