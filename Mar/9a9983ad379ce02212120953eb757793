"As the news started to sink in and investors absorbed the high profile departure of yet another internationalist from the Trump administration, it occurred that the constantly changing face of Trump's team speaks to an administration in disarray, and which might not be as market friendly going forward," noted CMC Markets Analyst, Michael Hewson. "It is also becoming increasingly difficult, given the constant revolving door nature of the arrivals and departures in his administration, to get a sense of which way the President is leaning on any of his economic policies." The firing of Tillerson came one week after Gary Cohn, a former president of investment bank, Goldman Sachs, resigned as Trump's top economic advisor in protest against the president's decision to levy global steel tariffs.Â
