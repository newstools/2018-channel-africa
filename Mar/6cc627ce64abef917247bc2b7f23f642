Last weekend, the Glamour Boys were involved in another 0-0 draw against KwaZulu-Natal outfit AmaZulu. As such, Amakhosi appear unlikely to challenge for the title as they are now seven points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns with six games left. "We got numerous chances to score, but we lacked the finishing touch to put the ball into the back of the net," Komphela told the club's website. "AmaZulu defended well in the first half, but to defend the way they did demands sustained concentration which costs energy. It's only possible to endure that kind of total focus for so long and thatâ€™s why we knew that we would get more goalscoring opportunities in the second half. "The table never lies, we are well organised defensively, but that doesn't mean that we play defensively. We have a lot of attacking players in the side. "Out of the 12 draws eight finished in nil-nil. That means that if we scored once, we would have won. "We should have won many of these games as we created many chances. Our lack of goals has hindered our progress." --News24--
