Signing the agreement with Cyprus-based Karo Resources, Mines Minister Winston Chitando said work would start in July, with the first output of platinum group metals expected in 2020, aiming to reach 1.4 million ounces annually within three years. It was unclear, however, where all the funding would come from and analysts said the project start date of July looked very ambitious. Located in the Mhondoro-Ngezi platinum belt, west of Harare, where Impala Platinum Holdings has operations, the project will include a coal mine and power station to produce electricity for the smelter, and should employ 15 000 people when fully implemented, Karo Head Loucas Pouroulis said. Keen to revive the mining sector after years of reticence by foreign investors during Robert Mugabe’s rule, Mnangagwa said the deal showed things had changed since his ascendancy after Mugabe’s ousting in November. “Zimbabwe is open for business and whoever stands in the way, hurting business in this country, will fall. It is not business as usual anymore, things have to change,” Mnangagwa said at the signing ceremony. The project was first mooted six years ago but had been held back by government red tape and “other unnamed vested interests, which are corrupt interests,” he said. Chitando added: “This is the largest investment structure in the country’s mining industry in Zimbabwe. The landscape of Zimbabwe’s mining industry will never be the same.” Zimbabwe’s government did not give details of the source of funding for such a big investment. --Reuters--
