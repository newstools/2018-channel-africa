Young players such as Lebogang Mothiba, Reeve Frosler and Phakamani Mahlambi were handed starts by coach Stuart Baxter, according to the Soccer Laduma website. After a quiet opening, Bafana slowly got into the game and they nearly went ahead after 17 minutes, but Aubrey Modiba's header was saved by Angola goalkeeper Lando Mavanga. Darren Keet, in goal for Bafana, was called into action in the 28th minute as he did well to keep out a long range strike by Djalma Campos. Three minutes later, the Angolans took the lead as Campos took advantage of a casual pass from Buhle Mkhwanazi before slotting past Keet. Baxter's charges failed to carve out another clear cut chance in the remaining stages of the half and went into the break behind. Bafana managed to level matters five minutes into the second half courtesy of cheeky flick from Mothiba. Baxter opted for a change on 70 minutes with Ryan Moon replacing Mahlambi, while Siphesihle Ndlovu came on for Modiba. Moon nearly made the perfect impact after 83 minutes, but his header sailed just wide of the upright following a corner from Themba Zwane. Neither side could find a winning goal in the closing, forcing the match into a shoot-out, where Bafana triumphed 7-6 to advance to the final where they will face Zambia, who beat Zimbabwe 5-4 on penalties after their semi-final was deadlocked at 2-2 after 90 minutes.
