South Africa accounts for close to 75% of global manganese reserves, Transnet said. The firm, which operates nearly three-quarters of the African rail network, the bulk of which is in South Africa, provides rail export lines for the country’s main commodities including coal and iron ore. Gert de Beer, Transnet’s new business development officer, said the firm will earn an estimated R10.4 billion ($880 million) from the seven-and-a-half year manganese export deal. He said a total of 12.5 million tons of manganese will be transported every year once Transnet signs contracts with nine local manganese producers, including South32. Most of the mineral will be from the Northern Cape province and will be hauled on the Saldanha and Port Elizabeth ore railway lines. Transnet said the contract with South32 will be back-dated, and will run from September 2015 until March 2023. ($1 = R11.81) --Reuters--
