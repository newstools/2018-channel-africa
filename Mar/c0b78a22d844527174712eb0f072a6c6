The 25-year-old pin-up, a four-time world champion and 2012 Olympic gold medalist, is six medals behind shooters Mick Gault and Philip Adams, who lead the way with 18. However, Englishman Gault and Australian Adams took six Games to reach 18 medals. Le Clos is aiming to do it in three, although he knows the odds are against him. "I don't want to sound like I'm looking for seven gold, because I'm not saying that at all," said Le Clos, attempting to play down his chances as he contests the 50 meters, 100 meters and 200 meters butterfly and 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle. "I could come away with two or three medals and not seven -- it's a very real possibility because I'm in very tough events," added the South African, who also goes in the 4x100 meters free and 4x100 meters medley relays. "The 100 meters freestyle is stacked, and the 200 meters freestyle is stacked. "The 100 meters and 200 meters fly will be very tough to win gold but I should medal in those events and the 50 meters fly, I just hope for a good start. "It could very easily be a great week but 0.1 (seconds) could decide the two on either side of the podium."
