Australia have been engulfed in a ball-tampering scandal which prompted regular captain, Steve Smith, and his deputy, David Warner, to resign earlier on Sunday and could claim more casualties in the coming days as Cricket Australia launch an internal review. That process is likely to be watched closely by the Australian public, who have been dismayed by sportsmen they once revered turning to cheating to get an advantage. Paine said the enormity of the ball-tampering scandal was sinking in for Smith, Warner and Cameron Bancroft, the young batsman tasked with trying to alter the state of the ball on the third day. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis said of Smith: "He is trying to take responsibility, so there is right in that but people are also responsible for their own actions. I can understand it is a tough time for him to be in right now."
