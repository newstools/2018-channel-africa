During OFF’s briefing in Bryanston, North of Johannesburg, the Forum’s Founder, Thor Halvorssen, said: We are here with an array of individuals who aren’t satisfied with the state of human freedom in the world and want to join the struggle to make a difference.” Chief Executive Officer of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Sello Hatang, said, “Madiba (Mandela) had three ideas when he established the foundation, democracy building, peace building and ensuring that we build a culture of human rights”. Activists participating in the forum include Malawian girl rights activist, Memory Banda,  Zimbabwean civil rights activist and #Thisflag movement leader, Evan Mawarire, Chinese-Canadian actress and human rights activist, Anastasia Lin, British-Somali female genital mutilation and gender rights activist, Leyla Hussein, Angolan investigative journalist and civil rights activist, Rafael Marques de Morais, Egyptian actor and LGBTQ rights activist, Omar Sharif Jr, Eritrean journalist and human rights activist, Meron Estefanos, Moroccan-born French human rights activist, Zineb El Rhazoui, first democratically elected President of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed as well as Palestinian writer and activist, Iyad el-Baghdadi. Malawi recently amended its marriage act and put the marriage age at 18 instead of 15, a victory achieved through Memory Banda’s activism. “I do not tolerate social injustice against girls. Traditions should not be justified to make young girls miserable’, said Banda. Mawarire who was late last year released from custody and acquitted of all charges, shared his optimism about the changes taking place in Zimbabwe and the region. “I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to be able to witness our region going through changes that most people never thought they would see in their life time”.
