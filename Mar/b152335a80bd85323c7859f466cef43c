Lawyer Miguna Miguna, was deported by Kenyan authorities in February for his role in a protest by opposition leader, Raila Odinga, who maintains he was the winner of an election that returned President Uhuru Kenyatta to power last year. 

Shortly before his deportation, which came after Odinga enraged the government by staging a symbolic "swearing-in ceremony", Miguna was charged with treason. More than 100 people were killed in unrest after last year's election. Earlier this month, a Kenyan court then ordered that Miguna's Kenyan passport be restored and that he be granted entry to the country. He landed at Nairobi's international airport on Monday  afternoon, his lawyer Nelson Havi said. Odinga came to the airport on Monday night to try to intervene on Miguna's behalf and said his Kenyan passport should be returned as a condition for political dialogue, according to Orengo. The scuffle at the airport comes after Odinga and Kenyatta announced they would heal their divisions and vowed to unify Kenya in a surprise announcement on March 9. Kenya's biggest newspaper, the Daily Nation, reported that plainclothes police slapped and kicked journalists covering the incident. The Nation published a photo of one of its cameraman holding up his bloodied arm.
