The Nigerian government on Wednesday announced the release of girls who were abducted by the Boko Haram insurgents at Government Science and Technical School in the north-eastern town of Dapchi on February 19. According to the latest update by the government, the number of school girls released Wednesday by terror group Boko Haram after their abduction last month has increased to 101. A total of 110 schoolgirls from the school were abducted. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, gave the update in a statement, saying the number could still increase as security agencies had commenced the profiling of the freed schoolgirls. Authorities said no ransom was paid to secure the release of school girls. The girls released were dropped off in Dapchi town at 3am on Wednesday, and not handed over to anyone. The release of the schoolgirls was the outcome of the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to all security agencies to do everything possible to secure the release of the schoolgirls, the government said. Nigerians interviewed by Xinhua expressed their happiness over the development and urged the government to take more concrete steps to avoid further abduction. --Xinhua--
