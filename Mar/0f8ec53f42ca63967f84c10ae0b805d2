Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria are among the countries that stand to capture investors’ attention, and their money, if yields on Egypt’s Treasury bills fall sharply this year, especially as the prospect of higher interest rates in the US fuels a battle for funds. Lured by high yields, more than $20 billion from overseas have surged into short-term Egyptian local-currency debt since authorities floated the Pound and secured an International Monetary Fund loan in 2016. The money has helped Egypt finance its deficit and boosted supplies of hard currency, paving the way for an economic recovery that President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi says will vindicate reforms painful for many Egyptians. “If yields drop enough, then Egypt’s market could be compared to Turkey, for example,” whose greater liquidity and longer history of foreign investment might swing sentiment in its favour, said Anthony Simond, who helps manage $13 billion of emerging-market debt at London-based Aberdeen Asset Management Plc. “That’s something to watch out for, but we’re not there yet.” With inflation falling to within the central bank’s target range for the first time last month, the regulator has started reversing the tight monetary policy it presided over in 2016 and 2017. Officials shaved 1 percentage point off the benchmark interest rate in February, and economists expect additional cuts of as much as 400 basis points this year. The yield on Egypt’s one-year T-bills began falling this year, even before interest rates were cut, as investors priced in lower returns. It’s now 1.6 percentage points below the beginning of January. Cairo-based CI Capital Asset Management sees a 3-percentage point plunge through 2018 to 11.8%, it said in a report. If yields in competing countries rise by 1 percentage point in the same period, as CI Capital estimates, investors could begin to exit Egyptian debt unless authorities take precautionary measures, it said. --Bloomberg--
