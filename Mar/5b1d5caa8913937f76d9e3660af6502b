Top seed Halep took time in between her own matches to attend the Williams' sisters match on Monday at WTA Tour's Indian Wells tournament. "It's always nice to watch them. I love the way that they are motivated and they are still playing at this age and Serena with the kid," said world No 1 Halep. "So it is great thing what they do for the sport and it is great that tennis has them. "Also I have many things to learn from them. That's why I am trying to go in and watch every time I can." Halep may be the top ranked player in the world but she is quick to point out the brilliance of Serena, who took an extended period of time off from the Tour to have a baby. Serena returned to the WTA Tour at Indian Wells but was eliminated in the third round when she lost 6-3, 6-4 to sister Venus. "I'm number one at the moment but I just watched the best player in the world," Halep said. Halep also praised the sisters for all they have done for women's tennis such as fight for equal pay at tournaments like Indian Wells which has a shared purse of $16 million. Venus next faces Carla Suarez Navarro, of Spain, in a quarter-final match on Thursday. It is the first time in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells for Venus since 2001. --afp--
