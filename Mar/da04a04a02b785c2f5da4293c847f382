Living alone in a miserable structure of plastic sheets and tin in a huge camp for displaced people, watching as relentless rains turned earth to mud, it all became too much to bear for the 44 year-old. "I have seen it all. When I thought about the lives of my relatives and their deaths, I decided to take my own life, too," Ayak says, falling silent as tears fill her eyes. She survived her suicide attempt but is only one of a growing number of people trying to end their own lives in the camp. Some 24 000 people are holed up at the site, located a short drive from Malakal, a once flourishing trading hub reduced to a ghost town by years of conflict. In 2017, 31 people in the camp attempted to kill themselves, 15 women and 16 men died, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The previous year, four people died. In December last year, South Sudan entered the fifth year of a civil war that has killed tens of thousands and displaced some four million people. With no peace deal in sight, and yet another ceasefire recently crumbling within hours of its signing, many of Malakal's dispossessed have lost hope. Their previous homes are just a few kilometres away in the nearby destroyed town. In the camp - known as a "Protection of Civilians" or PoC site, there is no privacy and most families sleep on thin mats on the floor, already dreading the rainy season, due to arrive in the weeks ahead. Movement is confined to the camp, clustered around a UN base, as many still fear insecurity on the outside. "People entered the PoC when they were children. Children are becoming adults here and are looking at the future and feel hopeless," says the Danish Refugee Council's country director Raphael Capony.
