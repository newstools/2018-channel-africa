The visit on Saturday falls into the SADC tradition of newly elected heads of state visiting their counterparts in neighbouring nations, his office said. He will discuss issues of regional and global importance with Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi and Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa. They will also focus in particular on political and security issues in the SADC region. Ramaphosa became president last month after the ruling African National Congress ordered Jacob Zuma to resign.
