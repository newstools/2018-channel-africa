Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority head, Shaun Abrahams, announced the reinstatement of the charges against Zuma.

Mshengu says Zuma's continued participation in the election campaign for the ANC will not dent the image of the party instead it will boost the ANC support. Nhlanhla Nxele reports... --SABC--
