National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams has just announced his decision. Abrahams says he informed Zuma of his decision earlier on Friday. However he declined to take any questions after the announcement. Zuma filed papers with the NPA on January 31. In the paper, Zuma gave reasons why he should not face fraud and corruption charges. The NPA had set an initial deadline of November 30, but after a request from Zuma, the former president was granted a seven-week extension. On November 30, South Africa’s biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), filed papers with the NPA outlining why 783 counts of corruption, fraud, money laundering, and racketeering against Zuma, should immediately be reinstituted.
