Despite struggling and making some key mistakes at times for the Brazilians, Madisha was included in Stuart Baxter's Bafana squad for the recent Four Nations tournament. South Africa won the competition as they beat hosts Zambia in the final 2-0 courtesy of goals from Percy Tau and Lebo Mothiba. However, despite being a part of the squad which went to Zambia and won the tournament, the player says his call-up came as a surprise following some patchy form for his club at Absa Premiership level. "Maybe the national team coach is also helping me to try improve my football," he told reporters. "He is also trying to help me to identify where I have been doing wrong and where I have been doing right. Being called up to the national team is a bonus because every player wants to be called up. I feel itâ€™s a good thing for me to be called up while I have horrible games. "I have to prove that I can be a better player. I have to prove that I can do it, whether I am under pressure or not." --News24--
