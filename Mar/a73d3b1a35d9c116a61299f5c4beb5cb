The company's Hong Kong-listed shares climbed more than 3% on Monday following the earnings announcement, and were up 2.88% at HK $6.78 in late afternoon trade. However, its Shanghai-listed shares slipped 2.78%. Net profit grew 10.13% to $8.1 billion, the company, whose official name is China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, said in a statement submitted to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Sunday. The company also proposed a 0.5 Yuan per share dividend for 2017. Bloomberg News said it was the largest such payout by the company since it went public in 2000. Sinopec largely credited solid demand for fuels stemming from China's continued economic growth for the profit gain. It said domestic consumption of refined oil products such as petrol, diesel and kerosene grew 6.6% compared to 2016, with gasoline demand rising 10.1% and kerosene up 11.7%. Chemicals consumption also "grew fast", it said.
