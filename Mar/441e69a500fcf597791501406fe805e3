Lesotho Minister of Foreign Affairs Lesego Makgothi earlier said the Kingâ€™s vehicles had been searched while he was held for an hour at the border. This comes amid complaints on social media about the border posts by disgruntled frequent travellers. They say border officials have deliberately slowed down service, and Lesotho passports are destroyed when travellers overstay due to the delays. Makgothi says South African Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba, will assess the situation over the next few days. --SABC--
