South African Minister of Energy, Jeff Radebe, on Wednesday announced the adjustment of fuel prices for April 2018 based on current local and international factors with effect from April 4, 2018. Radebe said that the main reasons for the fuel price adjustments are due to the increase in the fuel and road accident fund levies of 22 cents per liter and 30 cents per litre, respectively, as announced by the minister of finance in his budget speech in February. South Africa's fuel prices are adjusted on a monthly basis, informed by international and local factors.Â 

International factors include the fact that South Africa imports both crude oil and finished products at a price set at the international level, including importation costs such as shipping costs. The fuel prices schedule for the different zones will be published on Tuesday, April 03, 2018.
