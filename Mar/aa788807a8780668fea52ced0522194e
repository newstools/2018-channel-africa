The South African Constitutional Court extended the contract between SASSA and cash distributor, Cash Paymaster Services, by a further six months. 

The contract was due to expire on March 31, 2018. SASSA had brought an urgent application to the court saying it would not have been ready to pay the social grant beneficiaries who received their money in cash. 

SASSA was also concerned about the continued provision of certain electronic payment services currently provided by CPS, until the South African Post Office takes full control of these services. Pearl Magubane reports… --SABC--
