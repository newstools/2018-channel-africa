According to the official SAFA website, South Africa arrived in camp on Sunday evening with some of the overseas players reporting for duty on Monday, 19 March. Speaking at a media briefing held at the team’s hotel earlier today, the Bafana mentor highlighted that a balanced mix of youth and experience would be key in the team’s performance as they plan to use the tournament to prepare for the 2019 AFCON qualifiers set to resume later this year. “We have one training session here at home today (Monday) in the afternoon before flying to Zambia tomorrow morning which doesn’t really give us a lot of time,” said Baxter. “We do however have the right blend of youth and experience which we believe can gel well together to form the right combination and fighting unit” said Baxter. The squad has a clean bill of health with the exception of Wits defender, Buhle Mkhwanazi who has a slight hamstring injury which the medical team will monitor during the training session. The first game for Bafana Bafana will be against Angola on Thursday, March 22 at 15:00 with hosts, Zambia taking on Zimbabwe in an earlier fixture at 13:00. Both matches take place at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium --News24--
