When India needed five of the last ball, Kartik sent Soumya Sarkar's delivery over extra cover for six runs and was awarded the man of the match title for his spectacular match-winning innings of 29 runs off eight balls. On the bowling end, India's young sensation, off-spinner Washington Sundar, continuing his form bagged three crucial wickets to destabilize the cruising Bangladesh innings and was awarded the man of the series award becoming only the third player ever to bag the honour aged less than 20 years. We were all positive the kind of shots that he (Kartik) had in his ranks we always thought he could play those shots and put pressure back on them (Bangladesh), said Indian stand-in skipper Rohit Sharma who alsoÂ  batted comfortably to score 56 and keep India's chase on track India chased a target of 167 runs in Sunday's match- the highest successful chase in a T20I tournament's final. The previous record was held by Windies at 156 runs against England at Kolkata in World T20 2016 final. With this, India also became the first ever team to win three finals of T20 series or tournament. --reuters--
