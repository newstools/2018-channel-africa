President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi's victory is a foregone conclusion. His only challenger is Moussa Mustafa Moussa, a little known politician who joined the race in the last minute to spare the government the embarrassment of a one-candidate election after several hopefuls were forced out or arrested. Authorities hope enough people, there are nearly 60 million eligible voters, will vote in the three-day balloting that started on Monday to give the election legitimacy. Al-Sisi cast his ballot as soon as the polls opened at 09:00 at a girls' school in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. Local TV stations showed festive scenes outside polling centres, with women and school children singing. --Reuters--
