The company will participate in a week-long mission to the two West African countries later this month. "There are numerous infrastructure development projects in Ghana and Nigeria and our main objective of travelling there is to explore possibilities of participating in these projects and penetrate the West African region through these two strategic countries," MD Nhlanhla Maphalala said. He noted that most power and electricity transmission infrastructure in Africa operated at a fraction of installed capacity, owing to insufficient maintenance and lack of modernisation. "Across the continent, infrastructure such as power plants and transmission lines, is either disrupted, damaged or non-existent. However, investment in energy infrastructure is critical to the continent reaching its economic potential and exploiting its current growth trend,” Maphalala said. Participating in the mission would allow his company to collect extensive data on generation capacity and transmission networks and also to assess the demand and supply balance. "We need to align ourselves regionally. Regional integration needs to be looked at right down to the consumer level. The introduction of cross border projects can provide great economies of scale to the African continent," he said. "Critical infrastructure changes the economy from an employment perspective, and a key enabler and the rest follows. Supplying good infrastructure also makes us more competitive at a global level. Achieving development impact through increased access to electricity requires countries to mobilise private investments."
