Moussa’s presidential bid seemed to come as a surprise even to his own party. Hours before the candidate nomination window closed in January, a member of his team was photographed running down a Cairo street to the election commission to make the deadline. Until then, the obscure leader of the Ghad party had been organising events to endorse a second term for Sisi. Moussa denies suggestions by critics that he is running just to provide a candidate other than Sisi in the election, but is still vocally supportive of the former general and army commander and has said he hopes he wins. The former businessman’s apparent change of heart came after all other opposition candidates dropped out, citing intimidation of supporters, media vilification and an unfair campaigning environment after the arrest of the only serious challenger. Egypt’s election commission says the vote will be free and fair, and Sisi’s campaign says no candidate wanting to run has been blocked, but the events around other challengers have all but guaranteed Sisi a landslide victory. Moussa said in several interviews that leaving Sisi as the sole contender was “an image that was not suitable for Egypt.” “We have a positive role to play in the competition, so (our bid) comes not just due to our nationalistic motivations, we also think we have ideas to offer,” Moussa said in a January appearance on a television show. Moussa says he disagrees with Sisi on some policies, chiefly the implementation of a tough economic reform programme since late 2016 which has included a currency float and subsidy cuts. He promises to help farmers, reduce the soaring prices of basic goods, and increase wages to assist the many Egyptians who say they can barely afford enough food. --Reuters--
