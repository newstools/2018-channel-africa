Drogba played for Mourinho in two spells at Chelsea, first from 2004 to 2007 and then in the 2014/15 season. The striker has revealed his relationship with the current Manchester United manager was far from perfect, even if generally solid. "It was heated between us more than once, but Jose will never attack people he doesn't like," the former Ivory Coast striker claimed. "He likes Paul a lot. It's why he's given him a lot of responsibility." The former Blues star's claim comes amid speculation that Pogba and Mourinho are no longer on speaking terms.Â 

The French international was left on the bench for Manchester United's 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Brighton and Hove Albion, having featured as a substitute in their 2-1 Champions League last 16 defeat to Sevilla. Pogba and Mourinho both arrived at the club in 2016, with the former previously playing for United under Sir Alex Ferguson. They won the League Cup and the Europa League in 2016/17, but the FA Cup represents their only realistic chance of silverware this season. --AFP--
