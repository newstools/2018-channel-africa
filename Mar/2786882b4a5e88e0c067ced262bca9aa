Messi opened the scoring after two minutes and eight seconds, the quickest goal of his career, slipping the ball through Thibaut Courtois' legs from a tight angle. Chelsea coach, Antonio Conte, recognised Messi as the best player in the world and how he has been a decisive player to eliminate the Blues from the European competition. Once the match ended, the Italian coach praised Messi on the pitch and told journalists that it's right to give compliments to a great player when you have the opportunity to do it. Messi's virtuoso display also drew praise from his coach Ernesto Valverde who said that the Argentine is a warranty and always appears on the pitch when necessary. Chelsea's defence suffered during the match with Messi creating plenty of trouble. Barcelona reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the 11th consecutive season while Chelsea were left facing a battle to qualify for the competition again as they scrap for a top-four finish in the Premier League.
