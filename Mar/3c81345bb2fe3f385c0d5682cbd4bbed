Lasheen Ibrahim, head of the election commission, said the turnout Friday appears to be "good," without elaborating. Overseas voting started Friday and ends Sunday. Voting in Egypt takes place March 26-28. Ibrahim told reporters the commission received no complaints from any polling stations and the voting process went smoothly. Egypt's army chief-turned-President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is virtually certain to win re-election after a string of potential contenders withdrew from the race under pressure or were arrested. That left an obscure sole candidate, Moussa Mustafa Moussa, as the only rival. And he's a supporter of Sisi's government.
