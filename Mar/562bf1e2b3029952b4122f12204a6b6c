Mining companies including Glencore Plc and Randgold Resources Ltd. are pressing the government to row back on some of the reforms President Joseph Kabila signed into law this month. The modifications will raise taxes and other costs for operators in Congo, Africa’s top copper producer and the world’s main source of cobalt. “There can be no renegotiation on any point once the code has been promulgated,” Albert Yuma, Chairperson of state-owned mining company Gecamines, said in an emailed response to questions on March 17. Kabila met top executives from major foreign investors on March 7 to discuss their objections to the new law, which was approved by parliament in January. The president signed the code March 9, but assured miners that “their worries will be taken into account” in talks with the government. Representatives of Glencore, Randgold, China Molybdenum Co., Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., MMG Ltd., Zijin Mining Group Co. and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. attended the meeting. --Bloomberg--
