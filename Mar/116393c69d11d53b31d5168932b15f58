The decline of more than 50% is mainly due to a rise in energy earnings as oil prices have risen. Oil and gas exports were up 25% to $7.1 billion in January and February, in comparison with $5.67 billion in the same period last year, the customs data showed. Algeria, member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, relies heavily on oil and gas, which account for 60% of the budget and 95% of total export revenues. The recent recovery of oil revenues has provided some relief for a government that saw its revenues badly hit by the crash of hydrocarbon prices after mid-2014. Imports were down 10% to $7.2 billion, versus $8 billion in the same period last year. --Reuters--
