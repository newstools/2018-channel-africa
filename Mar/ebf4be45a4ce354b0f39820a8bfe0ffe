Amakhosi have endured a mixed 2017/18 season having begun their Absa Premiership campaign slowly, the club then embarked on a charge up the table over the first two months of the new year. Optimism was curbed by a goalless home draw against Bloemfontein Celtic and a 3-1 Soweto derby defeat to Orlando Pirate. However, Amakhosi bounced back with a 2-1 win over Stellenbosch on Saturday, to book their place in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals. "Football is a funny business," Komphela explained to SuperSport TV. "Last week [against Orlando Pirates] we performed well, and the result did not come. And you'll say: 'Do I want goals and not get [a good] performance?' They [the fans] will kill you for that. "They want you to win, and win in style, but if you can play in style and not win, it doesn't satisfy them because they are people of success, so it is important to go for the win." Komphela's side has been left with difficult but not insurmountable task in the league title race, as they trail leaders Mamelodi Sundowns by eight points with just seven games left in their season. But they will be confident of a prolonged run in the Nedbank Cup as they await the quarter-final draw on Thursday. --news24--
