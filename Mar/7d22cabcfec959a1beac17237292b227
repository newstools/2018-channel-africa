He said this in his court statement published by French media on Thursday. "I stand accused without any physical evidence because of declarations made by Mr Gaddafi, his son, his nephew, his cousin, his spokesperson, his former Prime Minister," Sarkozy told judges in remarks published by the Figaro website, a day after he was charged. "I've been living the hell of this slander since March 11, 2011" when Gaddafi first made the allegations, he added. --AFP--
