The S&P industrial index .SPLRCI was up 0.15%, helped by gains in Caterpillar (CAT.N) and General Electric (GEN.N) Shares of planemaker Boeing (BA.N) pared early losses to trade down 0.8%. The markets found support from economic data that showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to strength in labor market. A more than expected rise in US import prices in February indicated a steady pick-up in inflation. At ten in the morning ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average.DJI rose 0.37% to 24.848.55. The S&P 500.SPX gained 0.12% to 2.752.75 and the Nasdaq Composite.IXIC was down just 0.03% at 7.494.93. The indexes fell on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump sought to impose tariffs up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, while pressing for a cut in China’s trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said history showed trade wars are in nobody’s interests, but that China would protect its legitimate rights if "something happens we don’t want to see". "The problem is this type of rhetoric creates uncertainties and cap the markets," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. "We’re probably going to continue to slip in and out of the minus column for most of the day; we might be able to have a mid-session with upward bias." Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as well as on solar panels and washing machines has already sparked threats of retaliation from some trade partners. Shares in aircraft maker Boeing (BA.N) have shed 8.8% since March 1, when Trump announced his plans to impose tariffs.
