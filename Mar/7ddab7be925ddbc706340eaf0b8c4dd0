Bolt took part in the Football Match of Friendship in Basel under the watchful eye of Manchester United Manager, Jose Mourinho. The Jamaican said while he is enjoying his retirement from competition, he is keen to take on something new, saying he wants to be part of the soccer community. He says track and field was near its lowest point towards the end of his career, because of doping issues but he believes the situation will improve with the anti-doping measures put in place.
