The sixth-seeded Anderson beat the 20-year-old Tiafoe 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 to set up a duel with Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta, who dispatched his compatriot Fernando Verdasco 6-0, 6-3. Anderson, who lost at the quarter-final stage of the recently completed Indian Wells Masters, will be looking to reach a maiden Masters 1000 semi-final. It will be his 10th quarter-final at this level. Anderson takes a 4-0 head-to-head record into his clash against Carreno Busta, including a four-set victory during last yearâ€™s US Open semi-finals. The current world No 8 also beat the Spaniard in Indian Wells earlier this month. --News24--
