Rajan Nayer, the treasurer and marketing director of the Harare Metropolitan Cricket Association, was charged after offering Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer $30 000 to fix the result of the Test series with the West Indies last year, which the visitors won. Cremer informed coach Heath Streak of the approach and the matter was referred to the ICC. Nayer accepted a charge of breaching the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption Code. --AFP--
