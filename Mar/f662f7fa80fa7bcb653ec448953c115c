Four South African officials have been assigned to officiate the tricky Confed Cup match between Plateau United of Nigeria and Algeria’s USM Alger. The two sides meet in the second round of the CAF Confederations Cup on Saturday, April 7 in a fixture that CAF says requires high quality officiating. The two clubs are vying for a place in the group stages of the competition. Gomes who has officiated in a number of continental matches, will be in charge of the fixture and will be assisted by compatriots, Johannes Moshidi and Athenkosi Ndongeni. Thando Ndzandzeka will be the match’s fourth official with the match commissioner being Marceli Djiadeu of Cameroon."The trust bestowed upon SAFA by CAF is testament of the continuous hard work being put in by the Association. Refereeing is a critical component of the game that requires constant learning and improvement and as the Association, we strive to be the best exporters of quality referees on the continent," says SAFA’s Technical Committee Chairperson, Natasha Tsichlas. Both Gomes and Ndzandzeka have come under severe scrutiny this season after a number of howlers during the Absa Premiership campaign. Gomes was accused by both Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane and Platinum Stars counterpart Roger de Sa of trying to make headlines by making controversial decision. While Ndzandzeka recently sent off the wrong Golden Arrows player in a case of mistaken identity in a 2-1 loss to Orlando Pirates. The Association has also wished the remaining South African clubs well in their respective Champions League and Confederations Cup campaigns. Mamelodi Sundowns who won the competition two years ago are again in the group stages of the CAF Champions League while Bidvest Wits and Supersport United are competing in the Confed Cup. --News24--
