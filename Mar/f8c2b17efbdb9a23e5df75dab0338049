As Syrian government forces have advanced on the last opposition bastion outside Damascus, some 50 000 civilians have streamed out of the enclave into areas under regime control.  "The exodus is fairly chaotic. There is ongoing bombardment. It is a warzone," UN humanitarian agency spokesman Jens Laerke told reporters in Geneva. "We are deeply, deeply concerned for their safety," he said. The UN refugee agency also urgently called Tuesday for the protection of those who have fled and for the hundreds of thousands of civilians still trapped by fighting who are in "dire need of aid". UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic told reporters that "the shortage of appropriate shelter is a major concern." The agency was working around-the-clock distributing aid at makeshift collective shelters where thousands of families were arriving, "exhausted, hungry, thirsty and sick," he said. "The needs are overwhelming and growing by the hour," he added, warning that the shelters were overcrowded and lacked basic sanitation, with those displaced forced to wait for hours to use a toilet.    He stressed the need for humanitarian actors to be given unhindered access to civilians inside and outside Eastern Ghouta. He also urged the "full respect of the civilians' freedom of movement." Mahecic meanwhile said his agency was "aware of, but has no access to security screening reportedly taking place as civilians leave Eastern Ghouta." He said that UNHCR's partners on the ground were registering people who lacked documents, in particular unregistered newborn children, in a bid "to tackle this major protection concern with the Syrian authorities."  --AFP--
