The 'I Read' book club was founded in 2016 and has recently started displaying books in old boxes once used to store weapons and ammunition.Â The idea behind the use of these boxes is, according to the founder of the book club, Sofyan Qosaybat, a symbolic expression of replacing years of violence with the more beneficial habit of reading. Libya has been in instability since the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. Two rival governments and sporadic factional and tribal fighting have left the country, seven years on, still mired in conflict. The internationally recognised Government of National Accord in Tripoli is still unable to unite all factions together and gun battles in the country's main cities can go on for days, sometimes even weeks. Because of the ongoing conflict, the book club's work carries a lot of importance, said book fair visitor Abubakr al-Baghdady. "What this book club is trying to do is to prove that books are louder than the battle sounds, that words are stronger than bullets, and that books are more important than guns," he added. The book club has 100 members who collect books through donations and profits made from the book fairs, which they reinvest into buying more books.
