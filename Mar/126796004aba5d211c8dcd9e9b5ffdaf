Macron said everything leads them to believe that responsibility can be attributed to Russia and the work of the British services, shared with France's services, confirms it. "I condemn in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable attack," Macron told reporters during a visit to central France. "I will announce the measures that we are going to take in the coming days," he said.  

It was unclear whether the action would be counter-measures against Russia. Macron said he would discuss the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who is due in Paris on Friday. Meanwhile, Britain said on Thursday it will expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to a nerve toxin attack on a Russian ex-spy in southern England, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday, describing the attack as an unlawful use of force by Russia against the United Kingdom. May said Britain would also introduce new measures to strengthen defences against hostile state activities, freeze Russian state assets wherever there was evidence of a threat and downgrade its attendance at the soccer World Cup in Russia. Russia, which denies any involvement in the attack, called the measures announced by May “unacceptable, unjustified and shortsighted” and warned Britain to expect retaliation.
