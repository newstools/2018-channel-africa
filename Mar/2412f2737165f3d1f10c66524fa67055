Hundreds of homes in two villages were also destroyed in arson attacks in Ituri province over the last two weeks as fighting between the Hema and Lendu communities escalated. More bodies are being recovered which will push the death toll up. More than 150 people are believed to have been killed since December last year in the inter-communal fighting. Meanwhile, the United Nations deputy Secretary General in charge of humanitarian Affairs and emergency rescue has concluded a two day visit in the Democratic Republic of Republic of Congo. Mark Lowcok met with some of the country's authorities and visited some areas facing serious humanitarian crisis especially in the Tanganyika province. He says an amount of $1.7 billion is needed to bring a response to the humanitarian crisis in the DRC.
