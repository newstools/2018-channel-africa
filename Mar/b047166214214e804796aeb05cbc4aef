Abuja’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed confirmed that the talks have been ongoing for some time. President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has repeatedly said it was willing to hold talks with the militants. Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Boko Haram began its insurgency in 2009 - with the aim of establishing an Islamic state - an insurgency that has now spread from Nigeria to neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger. However, the group has been significantly weakened by a relatively successful military campaign carried out by the Nigerian army. But while Buhari has claimed the insurgents had been defeated, they continue to carry out regular attacks against both civilians and soldiers. The ongoing ceasefire talks was the reason the government was able to secure the recent release of more than 100 kidnapped schoolgirls last week after they were abducted from Dapchi in Yobe state in the north-east. A week-long ceasefire began on March 19 and it was during this period that the girls were returned in the middle of the night after a convoy of Boko Haram vehicles dropped them off in Dapchi. Six girls remain unaccounted for. One girl refusing to convert to Islam, angering the militants who then refused to release her.
