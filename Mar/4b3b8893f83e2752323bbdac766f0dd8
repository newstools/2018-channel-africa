The country's largest city, Zurich, set up its first bitcoin ATM four years ago, while the Swiss national rail company has since 2016 provided the possibility of purchasing the virtual currency at over 1 000 distributors across the country. Just a half-hour drive from Zurich is the small town of Zug, which thanks to a business-friendly taxation scheme has long been a global economic hub and is home to tens of thousands of companies, including large investment firms, pharmaceutical companies and commodity trading groups. But for the past few years, a new category of company has descended on the town, which in high-tech circles has been dubbed “Crypto Valley”. That is the name of an association set up in Zug in 2013 with the explicit aim of drawing startups dabbling in virtual currency technologies, creation and trading to the town. The push worked. Out of the world’s six biggest Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) an unregulated means to raise funds for new crypto-currency ventures in 2017, four took place in Switzerland, according to Swiss financial watchdog, Finma. Blockchain technology allows for the development of peer-to-peer payment systems. It runs by recording transactions as "blocks" that are updated in real time on a digitised ledger that can be read from anywhere and does not have a central record keeper. Zug is currently home to some 200 blockchain companies including the foundation behind ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. The town has also since 2016 accepted bitcoin payments for council services. The southern Italian-speaking Swiss town of Chiasso, which is attempting to compete with Zug as a “CryptoPolis”, has meanwhile decided to accept bitcoin payments for some taxes.
