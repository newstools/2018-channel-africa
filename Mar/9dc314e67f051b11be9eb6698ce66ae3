Some 5.3% of the workforce was out of a job this month, according to preliminary seasonally-adjusted data from the federal labour agency, in line with analysts' predictions. That was 0.1% points lower than in February and a new all-time low for post-reunification Germany. In unadjusted terms, less indicative of underlying trends but more prominent in public debate, unemployment fell 0.2 points from February's level, to 5.5%. Low levels of unemployment reflect strong economic performance in Germany, which booked growth of 2.2% in 2017, its fastest pace since 2011. A group of government economic advisors predicted earlier this month that the economy would expand even faster in 2018. Fewer people out of work has meant more consumers with money to spend at home supporting the economy, as a broader global upturn has increased foreign demand for German products. The flip side of the country's status as a global export powerhouse with exports outweighing imports by $302 billion in 2017 is particular vulnerability to trade war.
