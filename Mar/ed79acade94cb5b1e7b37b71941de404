The Kenyan conservancy taking care of the rhino, named Sudan, said the 45-year-old was euthanised after a rapid deterioration in an age-related condition led to changes in his muscles and bones and extensive skin wounds. While there are thousands of southern white rhinos still roaming the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, rampant poaching drastically cut the numbers of northern whites. Poachers can sell northern white rhino horns for $50 000 per kilo, making them more valuable than gold or cocaine. Sudan made headlines last year when conservationists put him on dating app Tinder, hoping to raise enough money for a nine-million dollar fertility treatment as all attempts to get him to mate naturally had failed. However, the fund-raising effort fell well short of its target. There is still a chance the northern white rhino will be revived though. A copy of Sudan's genetic material was taken on the day of his death in the hope that future technology will bring the species back from extinction. --Reuters--
