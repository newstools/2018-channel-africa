Infantino is in Peru for a summit in Lima on Tuesday with the leadership of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association (CONCACAF) and Spain. "This FIFA summit (is) an important summit where we have representatives, presidents, and secretaries general of federations from four continents, South America of course, North America, Europe and Africa, " said Infantino.  "And, we're going to speak about the future of football and we're going to prepare some decisions that we'll take on youth competitions, on women's competitions, (and) on development." Infantino also met with Luis Galarreta, the President of Peru's Congress on Monday. Infantino told a journalist he had "no opinion" on the case of Pablo Guerrero, a Peru soccer star who failed a drug test and received a one-year FIFA ban.  The ban was subsequently reduced to six months on appeal. --reuters--
