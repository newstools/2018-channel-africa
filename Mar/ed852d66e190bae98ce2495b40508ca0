FAW, a crop pest native to the Americas, arrived in Africa in 2016 and is already causing crop losses that threaten food security and livelihoods in more than 36 African countries. US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator Sean Jones is leading a group of agriculture experts, including representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of State, to accompany the African delegation as part of the technical exchange on FAW. The participants will learn about technical best practices and policy frameworks for enabling safe and appropriate use of effective technologies and sustainable approaches for FAW management.
