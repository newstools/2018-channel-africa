Nine-month operating profit stood at 1.3 billion Shillings ($12 million), acting Chief Financial Officer, Hellen Mwariri, said. Kenya spent most of 2017 conducting elections, which in addition to effects of drought, hit economic growth. The elections contributed to a 20% drop in domestic traffic, including in its East Africa markets, said Chief Executive Sebastian Mikosz. The airline, which is changing its financial year to match the calendar year, said passenger numbers stood at 3.4 million in the nine months to end-December. The airline completed a $2 billion debt restructuring in November as part of revival plans after a drop in Kenyan travel and high financing costs on new Boeing jets resulted in the countryâ€™s biggest ever corporate loss, 26 billion Shillings ($257 million), in its 2016 financial year. Kenya Airways reported pretax loss for the full year to end March 2017 of 10.2 billion Shillings ($100 million), while after tax loss was 9.96 billion Shillings ($98 million). Operating profit was 897 million Shillings ($887 million). ($1 = 101.10 Kenyan Shillings) --Reuters--
