The R20 ($2) per hour national minimum wage was supposed to start by May, following protracted negotiations at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) in 2017. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant has briefed journalists on the progress of the relevant Bill. She says due to the parliamentary processes which are currently under way, there is no way that the May deadline will be met. "Looking at the situation right now, it seems as if it’s not going to be possible. 

"It won’t be possible precisely because one the national assembly has not finalised the process. Before they finalised the process, then it won’t be possible to implement it. After the national assembly has finalised the processes. Then they will refer the legislation to the national council of provinces. Also, the National Council of Provinces will have its own programme to process the legislation."

"That is why I am saying it’s out of us as the executive because we don’t have the control of parliamentary processes as you are well aware that there is a separation of powers. Parliament will have their own programmes and processes."
