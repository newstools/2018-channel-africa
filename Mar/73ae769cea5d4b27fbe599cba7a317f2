The report relates to an investigation by a British law firm and internal inquiry into the conduct of Makwakwa. This, follows a threat by Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance to invoke Section 56 of the Constitution to force SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane, to disclose the information.Â 

Makwakwa was re-instated to his position last year. He was suspended after a report by the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) of suspicious multi-million rand deposits made to his personal bank accounts.

SARS later commissioned the British law firm, Hogan Lovells to investigate the FIC's report. Abongwe Kobokana filed this report.
