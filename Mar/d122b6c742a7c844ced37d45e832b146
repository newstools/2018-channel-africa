Both players were given the chance to impress in what was a larger than usual 25-man squad, Tite's last before naming the 23 who will go to the World Cup in Russia. Notably absent is Neymar, who is recovering from foot surgery earlier this month. Doctors have said the injury is expected to keep the PSG striker out of action for up to three months, which would be back just in time for the World Cup. Brazil play Russia in Moscow on March 23 and then face World Cup winners Germany in Berlin four days later. The five-times world champions kick off their World Cup campaign against Switzerland on June 17 before facing Costa Rica and Serbia. They have lost just once in the 17 matches since Tite took over, 1-0 to Argentina in a 2017 friendly in Australia, but the match against Germany in particular will be a big test and the first time they have faced the Europeans since they went down 7-1 in the World Cup semi-final four years ago. --reuters--
