Paceman Thakur led India's disciplined effort with the ball to restrict Sri Lanka to a below-par 152 for nine in a rain-hit match which was reduced to a 19-overs-a-side contest. Manish Pandey's mature 42 not out combined with Dinesh Karthik, who made 39 not out, in a 68-run partnership to help India overwhelm the target with nine balls to spare. Sri Lanka could not make the most of a blazing start and lost wickets at regular intervals to squander the momentum. Sri Lankan cricketer Thisara Perera on Tuesday (March 13) said the team lost since it could not execute its batting plan. Having avenged their loss to Sri Lanka in the tournament opener, India top the points table with two wins from three matches and they take on Bangladesh in the next match on Wednesday (March 14). --reuters--
