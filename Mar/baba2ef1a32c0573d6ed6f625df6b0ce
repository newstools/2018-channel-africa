The nail biting final lasted almost three hours as the raucous Southern California crowd cheered the 36-year-old Federer along, and both players took occasional issue with the chair umpire. Defending champion Federer had chalked up 17 consecutive wins in 2018, a run which included the Swiss winning his 20th grand slam title at the Australian Open, before his defeat by del Potro. The red-hot del Potro has now won 11 consecutive matches as he followed up his success in Acapulco by earning his first ever Masters 1000 title. --reuters--
