The Vatican had signalled on Tuesday Â its concern over results from the election, whose biggest winners were the League -- the largest party in a centre-right grouping that employed the most fiery anti-migrant rhetoric during the campaign -- and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. During the campaign, League leader Matteo Salvini clashed with the pope several times over immigration. When Francis backed a proposed law that would have granted Italian citizenship to children born in Italy of immigrant parents -- something the League vehemently opposed -- Salvini said Francis could house the children in the Vatican if he wanted to. --reuters--
