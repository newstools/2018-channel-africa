Amha Mekonnen has represented a number of the detainees. The lawyer told the Associated Press the arrests on Sunday afternoon occurred because they were accused of displaying a prohibited national flag. "I also understand they were accused of gathering en masse in violation of the state of emergency rule." Under Ethiopia's latest state of emergency declared earlier this year, people are prohibited from such gatherings without authorities' prior knowledge. A proclamation regarding the use of the Ethiopian flag prohibits the display of the flag without the emblem at its centre and those contravening the law could be sentenced to up to a year and a half in prison. Among those arrested are journalists Eskinder Nega and Temesgen Desalegn, politician Andualem Aragie and prominent blogger Befekadu Hailu. Government officials were not immediately available for comment. In a surprise move early this year, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced that members of political parties and other individuals would be released from prison in an effort to open up the political space for all after months of the worst anti-government protests in a quarter-century.
