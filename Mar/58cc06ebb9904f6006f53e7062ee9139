Sundowns are at the top of the table with 43 points, but have Pirates breathing down their neck in second position. The Buccaneers are only a point behind, but the Brazilians have a game in hand. The two teams will be back in league action on April 4, when Sundowns will be at home to Chippa United while Pirates host Bloemfontein Celtic. “I think the advantage for Sundowns is the quality they have in their squad,” Feutmba exclusively told Vodacom Soccer. “I believe they will go all the way and win the league based on how they have been playing in recent matches. I always say that Sundowns collectively is a very strong team, meaning their side is built around great individuals who thrive as a unit. One such individual is Percy Tau, who can create something out of nothing. “He is a very important player in that Sundowns team of today, but is also a good team player who gets along very well with his team-mates.”  Feutmba had a successful career with the Brazilians winning three consecutive titles from 1997. --News24--
