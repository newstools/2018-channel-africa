Despite the current stability in Darfur, the causes of the conflict which began in 2003 have yet to be addressed, Mamabolo told the United Nations Security Council via video-conference on Wednesday. 

He urged the UNSC to use its leverage to have Abdul Wahid Al Nur, who leads a faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army, to join the peace process. Aside from sporadic fighting in Jebel Marra, there is a general absence of war, a reality reflected in UNAMID’s adjusted mandate and posture, now in its second phase of reconfiguration. Since January, some military, police, and civilian personnel have been redeployed to strengthen Jebel Marra Task Force operations. The Force is organised in two sectors, the Jebel Marra Task Force, with headquarters in Zalingei, and the State Stabilisation Assistance Force, covering areas outside the former’s operation area. Phase II reconfiguration also entails reduction in the number of military personnel from 11.305 to 8.735, police from 2.888 to 2.500 and civilian staff from 2.918 to 2.760. While it is too early to assess the impact on the overall security and civilian protection situation in areas where UNAMID has withdrawn under its phase I reconfiguration, UNAMID continues to engage with the government to overcome access restrictions. In some areas of Darfur, intra and inter-communal clashes persist, albeit at a reduced scale, and instability persisted in internally displaced person camps in Kalma, Hassa Hissa and Hamadiya, where clashes are mainly fuelled by longstanding unresolved socio-economic and political issues at the root of Darfur’s conflict landscape over the years.
