As first vice-President, the tall 57-year-old appears to be the man anointed to take over, although his appointment is subject to an April vote in the National Assembly chosen on Sunday. President Raul Castro's assumed successor has spent three decades climbing to the summit of the Communist Party, ideally placed to continue to implement the economic reforms initiated by his 86-year-old mentor. He will be the first Cuban leader born after the 1959 revolution and perhaps crucially for some of the generals that will be under his command the first not to have fought for it. "There is a tradition in Cuba of strong men at the head of the State," said Cuban watcher Arturo Lopez-Levy of the University of Texas-Rio Grande. But "the profile of Muguel Diaz-Canel seems weaker," Lopez-Levy added. "He has no more power than what he has been given." In Havana's corridors of power, the jeans-wearing Diaz-Canel stands out, a self-declared fan of the Beatles with a passing resemblance to the actor Richard Gere. He has advocated greater openness to the internet and a more critical press. His supporters say that he "knows how to listen" and is a man of simple tastes.
