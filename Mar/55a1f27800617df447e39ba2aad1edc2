Egypt began the second of a three-day presidential election on Tuesday with Sisi set for an easy victory, after authorities urged people to cast their ballots to provide a strong mandate for the former military commander. Sisi, 63, who led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected President, Mohamed Morsi in 2013, is seeking a second term after a first four-year mandate he says has brought stability and security. The President faces just one challenger, who is expected to barely register against the incumbent, whom he supports. Critics have slammed the election as a charade after more serious challengers were forced to step down.
