Despite earlier reports, the PSL Disciplinary Committee came to the conclusion that it was not within its jurisdiction to hear an appeal made by Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City. The case regarding Ajax Cape Town fielding Ndoro was not dismissed in its entirety. The 32-year-old has played for Orlando Pirates, Saudi Arabian outfit Al Faisaly as well as the Urban Warriors in 2017/18. Ajax's decision to select the forward seems to contravene FIFA rules which state that a player can't turn out for three different teams in one season. SAFA confirmed that the appeal, heard by an independent third party will finally be decided on Wednesday. The PSL DC said in a statement: The Premier Soccer League (PSL) Disciplinary Committee has handed down a filing in respect of the Protests lodged by Orlando Pirates FC and Polokwane City FC against Ajax Cape Town FC for fielding Ndoro against them in matches which took place on January 31, 2018, and February 04, 2018, respectively. The Disciplinary Committee found that Ndoro’s eligibility had already been ruled upon by the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber as the issue of his eligibility fell within its sphere of jurisdiction. In the circumstances, the Disciplinary Committee ruled that lacked the necessary jurisdiction to hear the Protests and they were both dismissed. The Protesting clubs; Orlando Pirates FC and Polokwane City FC were ordered to pay the costs of the hearing. The appeal hearing against the DRC’s decision is set down for hearing on Monday 26 March 2018 before Adv. N. Cassim SC. --News24--
