Watson won six of the first seven holes in an all-American final en route to his second victory of the season, and the 11th of his PGA Tour career. The 35th seed clinched victory by sinking a seven-foot birdie at Austin Country Club. Kisner, the 32nd seed, seemed to run out of steam after going 19 holes in his morning semi-final against Alex Noren of Sweden. He played poorly in the final and handed Watson several holes. Watson had time for a leisurely lunch after beating American second seed Justin Thomas 3&2 in the other morning semi-final. After playing brilliantly for most of the week, Thomas was slightly off his game, hitting a series of shots that were surprisingly poor by his own high standards. The result cost Thomas the world number one ranking. Watson was seeded 35th for the Match Play despite his recent return to form highlighted by a victory at the Los Angeles tour stop at Riviera in February. His relatively low ranking is due primarily to last year's mediocre form that caused him to plummet down the list. --Reuters--
