The Revenue Authority said stock in cigarette maker Premier Tobacco Company that belongs to the family of Diane Rwigara will be sold at auction on March 28 to recover $6 million in back taxes. Their family says the trouble with the government started last year after Rwigara announced she would challenge Kagame in the August 4 presidential election. Election officials disqualified her before the vote and police arrested her in September along with her mother. Both women have been charged with inciting insurrection against the state and Rwigara also has been charged with forgery. --AP--
