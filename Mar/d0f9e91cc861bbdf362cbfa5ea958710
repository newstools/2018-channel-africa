German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries says Trump’s policies are putting the order of a free global economy at risk. "He does not want to understand its architecture, which is based on a rule-based system of open markets. Anyone, who is questioning this, is jeopardizing prosperity, growth and employment." Hours earlier in Beijing, Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said any trade war with the United States would only bring disaster to the world economy. US industries processing steel and aluminum have also criticized the tariffs as landing them with higher costs. Zypries added that Europe needed to avoid being divided by Trump’s offer to exempt some allies such as Mexico, Canada and Australia. Europe is the biggest exporter of steel to the United States, accounting for nearly 5 million tonnes of total annual imports of about 35 million, and Brussels has warned Trump it would impose countermeasures if hit. But the European Union and Japan on Saturday urged the United States to grant them exemptions, with Tokyo calling for "calm-headed behavior".
