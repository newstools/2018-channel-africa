After being held in pre-trial detention for nearly a year, Sall went before the court in January and February on charges of embezzling public funds. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year prison term for Sall and his financial director Mbaye Toure, and a fine worth nearly $10 million. A conviction could have far-reaching political consequences in Senegal, a country praised for its stability and democracy. It would bar Sall from standing in next year's presidential election, derailing a growing challenge to incumbent Macky Sall, who shares the same name but is not a relation. The 62-year-old Dakar mayor and seven co-defendants are accused of misappropriating $2.85 million of city funds between 2011 and 2015, a charge which Sall denies and which supporters say is politically motivated. They were also charged with fraud, criminal conspiracy and money laundering. The court heard allegations of a system of fake receipts for rice and millet, the money from which Sall is accused of using for "political purposes". Sall said the trial was fuelled by his refusal to cut deals with the government and that the money was used for spending on sensitive issues such as security. Often preferring a traditional boubou robe to suit and tie, he was upbeat during the case, smiling and greeting supporters who turned up for every hearing in their hundreds. "Should I be robbed of my right to be a candidate because Macky Sall doesn't want Khalifa Ababacar Sall to become his opponent in 2019?" the mayor asked combatively on the trial's last day. His long pre-trial detention and allegations of political machinations behind his arrest have perturbed the diplomatic community in a nation with strong democratic institutions. --AFP--
