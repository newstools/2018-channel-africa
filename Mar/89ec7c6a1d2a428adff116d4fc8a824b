Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) said on twitter that it had “received at least 20 000 Ethiopian asylum seekers in Moyale Town following their displacement from Ethiopia. At the weekend Ethiopian security forces mistakenly killed nine civilians in Moyale, located on the country's southern border with Kenya. The asylum seekers, majority of them being women and children, began streaming into Kenya on Saturday night, KRCS said. KRCS said it has already released family kits (Tarpaulins, Kitchen sets, Mosquito nets, Bar soaps, Thermal Blankets and Jerrycans), which were distributed among the displaced families.
