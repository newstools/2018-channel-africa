Under a 2015 peace deal that fell apart in 2016, the AU and South Sudan were supposed to set up a "hybrid court" consisting of South Sudanese and other African judges, to try people accused of atrocities. But the court has yet to be created. The AU is waiting for South Sudan to designate a government official to sign a memorandum of understanding on the court. Meanwhile, over 7 million people could become severely food insecure in coming months unless aid is urgently stepped, the United Nations has warned. Many who are on the brink of starvation are surviving on weeds and water lilies. The crisis has been fuelled by conflict that broke out in the country in 2013.
