Participants at the third intelligence and information sharing conference agreed that such information was crucial in averting future terror attacks in Somalia. Mohamed Sheikh Madobe, Director of Operations of the Somali National Army, who closed the forum, called for co-ordinate approach to effectively gather intelligence. He said the conference was aimed at improving the mechanisms and coordination of information sharing among diverse groups, with emphasis on intelligence sharing, which has been vital in preventing terror attacks in the Horn of African country in the past. A statement issued after the meeting said participants explored access to non-traditional information sources, discussed enhancement of intelligence sharing and dissemination, and emerging threats from terror group Al-Shabaab, even as the militants find themselves weakened from the onslaught from the government, AU and partner forces. Charles Tai Gituai, AMISOM Deputy Force Commander on Monday called for more efficient intelligence sharing modalities among actors. "Intelligence must be collected and used in a way that ensures operational efficiency without threatening the legitimacy and impartiality necessary for the peace mission to carry out its work effectively," he said when he opened the forum on Monday. --Xinhua--
