Jackson first met Mandela in July 1996, when he appeared at the former Statesman’s private birthday celebration. Mandela said that he was very happy to be able to host him, even for just a few minutes. He added that he has made a great contribution to art, music and was pleased with his arrival to South Africa. As their ‘friendship’ grew, Jackson visited and met Mandela in Cape Town in 1999. He announced his charity concerts titled "Michael Jackson & Friends - The Adventure of Humanity." The shows centred upon "the concept of giving" and the theme-song, "What More Can I Give". During the announcement the emotional pop star said: “I love this man (Mandela) very much and I love Africa.” The money raised from the concert went to three organisations, one being the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund. Jackson was not the only super star to form a ‘relationship’ with Mandela, watch below, to see how other celebrities helped the “celebrities’ celebrity” in his quest to fight for human rights and world peace.  --Molebogeng Seemela--
