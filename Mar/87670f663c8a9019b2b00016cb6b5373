Many Russians have prospered less than 18 years of Putin with high oil prices contributing to bumper growth rates before the 2008 global financial crisis. But the economy sank into recession after Western countries imposed sanctions on Moscow as punishment for its actions in Ukraine. A collapse in oil prices and the value of a rouble pushed up inflation, further squeezing household budgets. Although growth rebounded last year and inflation has fallen, many Russians feel poorer than in the boom years. Voters want Putin to make changes to the economy. But with little real opposition he is expected to easily secure a fourth presidential term so there is not much incentive to present a concrete plan. And with so much disagreement among officials it would be a challenge to put one together. Chris Weafer, a senior partner at economic and political consultancy Macro Advisory, said the Kremlin had created a “golden monster” of expectations that living standards would keep rising. "We are at the point where people are aware that their lifestyle has deteriorated, or the prospects for improvement aren’t great," he said. "They want the government to do something about it, or have moved to demanding the government do something about it. The government is listening but nobody knows what to do." The Kremlin and the economy ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Putin has repeatedly called for higher living standards and said at his annual address earlier this month Russia should “increase GDP per capita by half” by the middle of next decade.
