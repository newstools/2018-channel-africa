Sarkozy, 63, arrived just before 8am (0700 GMT) at the bureau of officers specialising in corruption, money laundering and tax evasion in the western Paris suburb of Nanterre, an AFP journalist said. He was first taken into custody on Tuesday morning, but left the police building around midnight. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. Since 2013, investigating magistrates have been probing media reports, as well as statements by Gadaffi's son Seif al-Islam, which claimed funds were provided for Sarkozy's run at the presidency. The case is France's most explosive political financing scandal and one of several legal probes that have dogged the right-wing politician since he left office after one term in 2012. Brice Hortefeux, a Sarkozy ally who was a top minister during his presidency, was also questioned Tuesday until about 11:30 pm. "Testifying freely, the details provided should put an end to a series of errors and lies," Hortefeux later wrote on Twitter. Under French law Sarkozy can be held for questioning for up to 48 hours, after which he can be released, told to return for further questioning later, or brought before a judge to potentially face charges. The prosecution claims Sarkozy spent nearly double the legal limit of 22.5 million Euros ($24 million) on that campaign, using false billing from a public relations firm called Bygmalion. He faces up to a year in prison if convicted, but he is appealing the decision to send him to trial, claiming he knew nothing about the fraudulent practices that Bygmalion executives have admitted to. Sarkozy failed with a comeback bid for the presidency in November 2016 and has stepped back from frontline politics since then, though he remains a powerful figure behind the scenes at the right-wing Republicans party. --AFP--
