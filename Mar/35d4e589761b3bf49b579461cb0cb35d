The reduction in salaries, in some cases by as much as 50%, was implemented this month despite a court order directing the government not to implement salary reviews made by the National Police Service Commission (NPSC). The Central Organisation of Trade Unions Kenya said the reduction in pay went against the International Labour Organisation’s Convention 95 on protection of wages. Furthermore, resigning wasn’t easy for the officers as police are required to give up a month’s salary and provide 24-hour’s notice when terminating their services according to Kenyan law. Alternatively, a resigning officer can serve out a three-month notice period which most of the officers are trying to avoid. Only those who have served for 12 years are eligible for termination benefits. Kenya’s Daily Nation reported that a group of the affected officers met at a Nairobi hotel on Sunday to discuss the way forward and contribute money towards legal fees as they implement legal action against the NPS.  --IOL--
