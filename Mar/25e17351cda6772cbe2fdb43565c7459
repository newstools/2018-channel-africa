Trump last week ordered the imposition of duties on incoming steel and aluminum and threatened to levy a tax on European cars if the European Union did not remove "horrific" tariffs and trade barriers on a range of goods. "The German economic upswing is continuing at the beginning of 2018. The global economic environment is still favourable," the Economy Ministry said in its monthly report. But it said U.S. trade policies were creating a sense of uncertainty. The tariffs on steel and aluminum will affect trade flows in some regions, but their overall implications for the global economy are likely to be manageable, it said. "But a possible escalation into a trade war and rising uncertainty among market participants could cause tangible damage,' it added. European Council President Donald Tusk on Wednesday urged the United States to revive trade talks rather than escalate a dispute over tariffs on metals and cars. Germany’s transatlantic coordinator Juergen Hardt also pushed for a quick resumption of negotiations between Brussels and Washington on a free trade agreement, known as TTIP. "It was a big mistake not advancing this," Hardt told lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament. Germany favors the abolition of all tariffs and other forms of trade barriers between the United States and the EU, Hardt said, adding: “Our offer is TTIP and (US Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer is invited to come back to Brussels soon."
