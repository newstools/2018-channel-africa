Demonstrators blowing vuvuzelas and beating drums filled Accra’s business district, holding placards criticising a new deal with Washington that they say threatens Ghana’s sovereignty. Police estimated the crowd size at about 3 500 protesters. While officers in riot gear were present, no violence was reported. International powers including the United States and France are looking to extend their presence in the remote Sahel region in particular, where al Qaeda and Islamic State militants have gained a strong foothold in recent years. Under the deal approved by Ghana’s parliament last week, the United States will invest around $20 million in training and equipment for the Ghanaian military this year. Opposition lawmakers boycotted the parliamentary vote. In return, the US military will be allowed to deploy troops and import military equipment tax-free, use an airport runway that meets US standards, and have free access to Ghana’s radio spectrum. Ghana has had a long-standing military and trade ties with the United States, but many say the latest agreement was a step too far. Responding to local press reports concerning the deal, the US Embassy in Accra underscored in a statement last week that it had no plans to establish a military base in Ghana. It said the existing 20-year-old co-operation agreement “does not cover the current range and volume of bilateral exercises and assistance.” Four elite US soldiers were killed in Niger alongside local troops in an Islamist ambush in October, sparking a fierce debate back home about covert US actions in West Africa. The United States has about 7 200 US Defence Department personnel, including soldiers, stationed in Africa. Over half of those are stationed at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, with the remaining personnel scattered across 32 other smaller locations. --Reuters--
