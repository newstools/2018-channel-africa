Tottenham and England striker Kane will be out until next month after damaging ankle ligaments in the Premier League win over Bournemouth. Kane, who has scored 35 goals for Spurs this season, injured his right ankle in a collision with Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Chelsea are fifth in the Premier League table, five points behind fourth-place Tottenham, ahead of the London derby at Stamford Bridge. Wilkins told Sky Sports: "It's a must-win against Tottenham on Sunday, absolute must-win. Tottenham are without Kane, which gives Chelsea the edge. "Tottenham are in good form, I think Chelsea playing against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge will have the upper hand. "We have got to be on the front foot. We have to make sure Tottenham suffer. Therefore, I would play N'Golo Kante and Cesc Fabregas in midfield." Kick-off is at 17:00 (SA time). --News24--
