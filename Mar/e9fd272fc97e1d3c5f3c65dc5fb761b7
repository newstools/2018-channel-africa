The southern African country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 1.0% year-on-year in the fourth quarter after a 1.0% drop in the third quarter. For 2017 as a whole GDP fell 0.8% versus growth of 0.7% in 2016. The statistics office said construction contracted partly because of a drop in investment in mining, while hotels and restaurants also performed weakly. Agriculture and mining output both grew. Namibia’s economy is closely linked to that of its neighbour, South Africa. It is a major producer of diamonds and also mines uranium, zinc and gold. Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Namibia’s credit rating to “junk” status last year, citing weaker-than-forecast fiscal outcomes. --Reuters--
