In November last year, a timetable for presidential elections in December 2018, two years after Kabila's mandate ended and a year later than the date set by the December 2016 accord that the Catholic church helped broker was lauded by the African Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). 

However, critics say SADC, under the chairmanship of South Africa, appears ill-prepared to decisively deal with ongoing crises in the DRC. A round-table discussion was held in Johannesburg earlier this week to dissect this ongoing crisis and SADC's role in resolving it.
