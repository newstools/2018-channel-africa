The European Commission accused Trump of “cherry-picking” data to distort the debate in a transatlantic dispute over US metals tariffs that threatens to become a trade war. The EU is seeking to be exempted from planned US import duties of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but says Washington has not made clear how the exemption process works. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday the United States was ready to drop its tariffs if the EU lowered its"horrific" rates on US products. On Monday, he tweeted that Ross would be speaking with EU representatives about eliminating " tariffs and barriers". "Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers,"he wrote. White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said Ross will work closely with US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, on determining country exemptions from the steel tariffs.

Walters also said they will specifically see "whether proposed measures between the United States and another country will address the national security threat posed by that country’s export to the United States of steel or aluminum products." Ross also has primary responsibility for overseeing a process under which companies can petition to exclude specific steel and aluminum products from the tariffs. A Trump administration official said these procedures are awaiting final clearance and are expected to be published within a week.
