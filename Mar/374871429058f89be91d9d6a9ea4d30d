Other data on Thursday showed a rise in the prices of imported goods in February amid US dollar weakness, bolstering expectations that inflation will pick up this year. Labor market strength and a steady increase in price pressures could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4000 to a seasonally adjusted 226 000 for the week ended March 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims decreased to 210 000 during the week ended Feb. 24, which was the lowest level since December 1969. Last week’s drop in claims was in line with economists’ expectations. It was the 158th straight week that claims remained below the 300 000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Fed officials consider the labor market to be near or a little beyond full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. The economy created 313 000 jobs in February. Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will boost wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to underpin consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year. Data on Wednesday showed retail sales fell in February for a third straight month. Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 1.7% annualized rate. Reports on home sales and industrial production in January have also been weak. The economy grew at a 2.5% pace in the fourth quarter. The US dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies after Thursday’s data while US stock index futures moved higher. Prices of US Treasuries were trading mostly lower. Diminishing labor market slack is also expected to help boost inflation toward the U.S. central bank’s 2% target.
