"We welcome the de-escalation of tension on the Korean Peninsula and support all the efforts that will help resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiation.

China will play its role in this regard and will also do its best to promote, uphold and realize the denuclearisation of the Peninsula, and maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula," said Li.
