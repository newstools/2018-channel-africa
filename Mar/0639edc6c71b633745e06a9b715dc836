Diego Costa was back in the starting line-up for the first time in eight international matches and he marked his return with the opening goal as Spain ripped apart an opponent supposedly also in the running for the title in Russia. Isco then scored twice either side of what proved to be no more than a consolation goal from Argentina's Nicolas Otamendi, before Thiago Alcantara added a fourth before the hour. Substitute Iago Aspas made it five, latching onto a long pass downfield from David de Gea, only for Isco to score his third, and Spain's sixth, with 16 minutes left. As irresistible as Spain were going forward, Argentina were lamentable at the back and coach Jorge Sampaoli will have questions to answer with the World Cup less than three months away. He might cling to the hope of Lionel Messi, whose hamstring strain meant he was not even in the squad at the Wanda Metropolitano, instead left to watch on from the stands. Sergio Aguero and Angel Di Maria were also out injured but Argentina's problem was less creating chances than containing Spain's as Costa, Isco and Marco Asensio simply proved too quick to catch. Asensio is likely still to give way to David Silva but Costa showed he is ready to be Spain's main striker, this game completing his reintegration after an autumn disrupted by his Chelsea departure.
