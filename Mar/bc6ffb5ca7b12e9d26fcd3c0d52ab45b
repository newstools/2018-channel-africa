Milan are losing 2-0 to Arsene Wenger's team after the first leg of their Europa League Round of 16 tie in the San Siro last week. On Tuesday, Gattuso watched Sevilla - led by his predecessor, Vincenzo Montella, cause an upset by beating Jose Mourinho's Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Gattuso admitted his team faced a tough match against Arsenal who have had an upturn in form after a four-match losing sequence in all competitions, before beating Milan away followed by a 3-0 Premier League win at home to Watford. However, they are 12 points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool with their most realistic hope of qualifying for next season's Champions League is by winning the Europa League. Milan midfielder Suso, who used to play for Liverpool, said the Premier League was really competitive and backed Arsenal to be challenging for the top positions again soon. Arsenal's good fortunes have coincided with good performances by midfielder Jack Wilshere who Gattuso praised highly at his pre-match news conference on Wednesday (March 14). Wilshere's contract expires at the end of the season and he has been linked with a transfer away from Arsenal. Milan goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, 18, has also been linked with a transfer in the summer but Gattuso said the highly rated youngster needed to focus on just playing soccer for the immediate future.
