Polls will be open for three days and Sisi, a former military commander, has urged Egyptians to go and vote, hinting that he sees the election as a referendum on his four-year rule. Sisi's sole challenger in the March 26-28 vote is Moussa Mostafa Moussa, a longtime Sisi supporter widely dismissed as a dummy candidate: Moussa's Ghad party had actually endorsed Sisi for a second term before he emerged as a last-minute challenger. Sisi, 63, who led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, has cast his bid for a second term as a vote for stability and security.
