The story led the front pages of all of the country's major newspapers, the headlines mostly working around the single word "Shame", and even Australia's Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, intervened on Sunday to demand quick action from Cricket Australia and they, after initially demurring, responded by standing down Smith and vice-captain, David Warner, from their roles. In the space of two days, top batsman Smith has gone from Australia's cricketing golden boy to national pariah and it looks likely that he has played his last test as captain. Smith was handed a one-match ban and fined 100%of his match fee for his part in the scandal by the International Cricket Council, while the junior player involved, opener Cameron Bancroft, was fined 75% of his match fee.
