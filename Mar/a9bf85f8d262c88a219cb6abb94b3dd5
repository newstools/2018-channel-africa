In a claim that's coming back to haunt him, the former Zimbabwe strongman announced in 2015 that $15 billion of diamonds was spirited out of Marange, the dusty fields more than four hours drive from Harare which were the site of a bloody military clampdown in 2008. After 37 years in power Mugabe, 94, was pushed out of office in November 2017, but anger against him, his wife and those closest to him remains deep and polarising. Zimbabwe media Â said that MP Temba Mliswa, who chairs the Mines and Energy Portfolio committee told a top police chief who'd been asked to testify about looting in Marange this week: "The committee has equally resolved that the former president will equally come." He only comes when we have heard from all institutions he was responsible for so we are leaving no stone unturned," the website reported Mliswa as saying. Mliswa is an independent MP who still has links with Zanu-PF.
