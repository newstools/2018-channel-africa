The match takes place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and comes less than two months after Amakhosi defeated Bakgaga 2-1 in a league match. It was in this match where Castro, who joined the Glamour Boys from Mamelodi Sundowns, netted his first goal in the colours of Chiefs. The strike was recently selected as the Absa Premiership Goal of the month for January. Chiefs wade into the match still chasing their first trophy under the mentorship of Steve Komphela, who will be out of contract at the end of the season. Castro told the club’s website: "We need to fight if we want to reach the semi-final. We need to be ready from the moment that the referee blows the whistle to kick-off the game. We want to score early. Baroka always approach their games with a ‘do-or-die’ attitude, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. "They can’t be underestimated. This means that we must be focussed from the start and take care of business with a sound game plan and a determination to win. We need to look forward as well. The Nedbank Cup is an opportunity to win a trophy this season." --News24—
