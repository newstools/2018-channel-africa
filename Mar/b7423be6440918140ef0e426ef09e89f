FIFA has already said the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system would be used at soccer finals if approved by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). But there has been some resistance from some soccer fans and officials, with FIFA's European counterpart UEFA reporting the technology will not be deployed in next season's Champions League. The final decision on using the system at the June 14-July 15 World Cup will be taken at an upcoming meeting of the FIFA Council in Bogota later in March. Critics say VAR has led to confusion in competitions where it has been used, especially for spectators in stadiums who are often unaware that a decision is being reviewed. But Infantino dismissed the criticism. Also on Infantino's soccer agenda is the issue transfer fees for players. In February, the FIFA President said agents fees have taken a "worrying" direction and need to be better regulated to guard against bribery, corruption and money laundering. Officials reported spending on international transfers had totalled around 4.6 billion euros ($5.5 billion) during the northern hemisphere summer compared to 3.6 billion euros for the same period the year before. These included Brazilian forward Neymar's record-shattering 222 million euro move from Barcelona to Paris St Germain, plus 18-year-old French forward Kylian Mbappe's move to the same Ligue 1 club. Infantino's visit to the Andean nation comes after Peru expressed interest in hosting the under-17 World Cup. Officials have not specified if the hosting bid is not for the 2019 or 2023 tournament. Soccer is Peru's most popular national sport but has had a difficult time qualifying for the tournament against South American heavyweights like Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. After a 36-year drought, Peru returns to this year's World Cup in Russia.
