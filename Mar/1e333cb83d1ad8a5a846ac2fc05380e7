Speaking during a joint news conference with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw, Merkel also said that the future of the entire European Union was important for her government, not just the future of the eurozone or some other group of states. Morawiecki expressed confidence that European Union concerns over Poland's judicial reform could be overcome, telling reporters he saw "light at the end of the tunnel." Merkel had said she hoped authorities in Warsaw would satisfy Europe's concerns over the rule of law in Poland, as the two countries also faced gaps to bridge over migration and a new gas pipeline. In December, the European Commission launched a rule-of-law procedure - known as Article 7 - against Poland over reforms that Brussels says undermine the independence of the country's judiciary. --reuters--
