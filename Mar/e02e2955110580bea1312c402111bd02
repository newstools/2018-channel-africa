Sun International said diluted adjusted headline earnings per share, which the group considers the most meaningful measure of its performance, fell to 298 cents in the full year ended December 31 from 503 cents in the previous year. The group incurred a number of once-off or abnormal items that included an onerous lease contract provision in Colombia of R50 million ($4.16 million) relating to the Sun Nao Casino and restructuring costs of R43 million ($3.5 million) relating to the Sun Nao Casino, Morula and Fish River closures. Revenue increased 12% to R15.6 billion ($12,9 million) with growth attributable to the inclusion of the results of its Sun dreams merged entity in Latin America and new Time Square casino.
