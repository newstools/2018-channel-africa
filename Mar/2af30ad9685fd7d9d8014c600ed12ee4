A suicide attacker exploded his vehicle at a barricade manned by forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar near the city of Ajdabiya some 840 km from Tripoli, General Fawzi al-Mansouri, a top officer in the local security forces, told AFP. Eight other people were injured. "Five people died on arriving at the hospital shortly after the attack," a source at the city's public hospital told AFP. The three other victims died later of their injuries, the source who requested anonymity said. "There were civilians among the dead and injured," Mansouri said, adding that no one has yet claimed responsibility. A suicide attack which injured three people on March 9 south of Ajdabiya was claimed by the Islamic State group. Despite the loss of its Sirte stronghold in northern Libya in December 2016, ISIS remains active in the centre and south of the country. --AFP--
