The outlook for Huawei, which trails Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in smartphones, is clouded by strong competition in the domestic market and declining sales in the United States, as Washington plans higher import tariffs on China’s tech products. Shenzhen-based Huawei saw net profit for 2017 rising to $7.3 billion, a big rebound from last year’s 0.4% increase. The rise is largely attributable to a 85% drop in net financing expenses as the company booked smaller foreign exchange losses. Revenue grew 15.7%, in line with the company’s previous guidance and its slowest growth in four years. Huawei vowed to focus on improving profit after posting the slowest profit growth in five years in 2016 as its slim-margin smartphone business weighed down profit growth. Huawei’s consumer business, which includes smartphone operations, grew at a slower 31.9% to $37.85 billion after shipping 153 million smartphones in 2017. The year earlier the segment had grown 43.6%.
