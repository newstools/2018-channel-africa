However, the cost of the cars alone far exceeds the $1.7 million budget the government allowed itself for the festivities to mark the two occasions, Swazimedia. "The Taiwanese Government donated $1.3 million but that still leaves the land-locked kingdom 4.5 million short on the cost of the cars alone," said Rooney. Swaziland local newspapers reported that the cars would be used by the Close Protection Unit of its security services which is responsible for protecting dignitaries. There was no verification of how many vehicles had been purchased and Lindiwe Dlamini, Minister of Public Works and Transport, failed to respond to questions sent to her by the ministry in regards to the purchase. The cars were bought through the government’s Central Transport Administration (CTA). The CTA was lambasted by the auditor general’s most recent report for illegally spending millions of emalangeni and not keeping proper financial records. Rooney said the purchase raises questions about the lack of financial control around the 50/50 celebrations.
