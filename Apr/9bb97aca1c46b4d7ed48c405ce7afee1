At a press conference during his visit to Ireland, Barnier called for a "clear and operational solution for Ireland" to be included in the Brexit deal, adding: "Until we reach this agreement, there is a risk". Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that Britain's "approach to negotiations will need to change in some way" if there is to be agreement over the issue. "Without a solution to the Irish border question, there can be no EU withdrawal agreement," he added. London has committed to avoid a "hard border" with checkpoints between Northern Ireland, part of the UK, and EU-member Ireland, which all sides agree is vital to maintaining the 1998 Good Friday peace accords. However, Britain has also said it will not enter into a customs union with the EU post-Brexit, and has been urged to find a solution to reconcile the two positions. The EU has suggested a "backstop" proposal, in which only Northern Ireland would stay in a customs union with the EU post-Brexit. "The backstop we put in the draft treaty, is not there to change the UK red lines, it is there because of the UK red lines on the customs union and single market," said Barnier. "Only Northern Ireland-specific solutions will work," he added. "We need to agree rapidly by June on several new points, on the scope of alignment, customs and regulations." Britain wants to be free of the EU customs union in order to be able to strike trade deals with the rest of the world post-Brexit. Barnier rejected claims that the backstop solution threatened Britain's sovereign integrity following criticism from Arlene Foster, head of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  --AFP--
