The 20-time Grand Slam winner arrived in the country on Sunday to check on his foundation, which operates in the rural parts of Zambia. The Roger Federer Foundation, which aims to provide equitable access to quality basic education to children, began its work in Zambia in partnership with People’s Action Forum in August 2011. According to the Foundation’s website, as the Zambian government often cannot make education available to the people in these areas, the communities themselves established and community schools. The aim of the initiative is to support and strengthen these primary schools. The Board of the Roger Federer Foundation has approved a total budget of 1.6 million Swiss Franc ($1.6 million) for this purpose. The programme has reached 85 000 children in total so far. --Lusaka Times--
