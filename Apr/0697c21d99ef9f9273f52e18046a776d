She has described the nature of their relationship during the good and bad times in their family. Zukiswa says they have learnt from her, as she always took the leading role in the family in all occasions. She says Mama Winnie was not just a sister and a mother to them alone, but to the whole nation. “To the women of South Africa the mother of the nation has left a legacy that you should nurture and carry forward in order to honour her. To the Madikizela and Mandela families I am not going to say much, our pain is shared. Our sister has done a lot for her people. Let that not be the last contribution we make to this country.”
