The name change was announced more than a week ago, during the celebrations of the Monarch’s 50th birthday and the nation’s 50 years of independence. The Party’s Secretary General, Kenneth Kunene, says the name change will not bring transformation in the country. "The only way that Swaziland can transform, is when it is a democratic republic. 

"Being a democratic republic will mean people taking charge of the country, using institutions and political systems that will make sure that when they run the country their voices are heard, not a particular elite of a family that can determine how Swaziland should be run," says Kunene. --Nomsa Mdhluli--
