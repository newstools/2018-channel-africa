This was the second release of children in a series, supported by United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) that will see almost 1 000 children released from the ranks of armed groups in the coming months. The first release of children took place in Yambio Town in early February, where more than 300 children were released to return to their families, or to UNICEF-supported care centres. This latest release of a further 207 children continues that effort and took place in a rural community called Bakiwiri, about an hourâ€™s drive from Yambio, in Western Equatoria State.
