Twenty countries across sub-Saharan Africa have now abolished the death penalty for all crimes, Amnesty International says in the report released early Thursday. Just two countries in the region, Somalia and South Sudan, carried out executions last year. Executions worldwide dropped again in 2017, with at least 993 recorded in 23 countries. That's down 4% from the year before and down 39% from 2015. At least 2 591 death sentences were recorded in 53 countries last year, down from a record high of 3 117 the year before, the London-based human rights organization said. The numbers don't include the thousands of executions and death sentences that Amnesty International believes have occurred in China, where they are considered a state secret. China remained the "world's top executioner, the report said. Excluding China, 84% of the reported executions last year were carried out in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan. Countries resuming executions in 2017 were Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.  --News24--
