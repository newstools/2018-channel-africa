Bralirwa is Rwanda's oldest brewery and has rights to produce beer brands such as Amstel. It also produces branded soft drinks such as Coca-Cola. It said its sales volumes fell by 12 % to $17 million in 2017, hurt by the impact of price rises of both soft drinks and beer and strong competition. “We used to be in a monopoly situation in 10 years ago and now we are facing strong competition from local production coming from Skol but also from imports from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya,” Victor Madiela Managing Director, said. --Reuters--
