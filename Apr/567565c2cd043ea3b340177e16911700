First half strikes from Themba Zwane and Sibusiso Vilakazi saw Sundowns to the win. "This game was very important. I didnâ€™t want to highlight it too much, but in the dressing room, they knew about it. It gives us for the fourth year in a row a (CAF) Champions League spot," Mosimane told SuperSport. "It also gives us a six-point gap between us and Orlando Pirates." Mosimane still saw room for improvement in his side's performance, but was pleased with the way they came out of the blocks flying. "I think we started very well to be honest. We created chances, scored our first two goals. Sometimes we elaborated too much, passing and passing instead of shooting, but we scored the two goals and thats it," he said. "Second half, you know the story, they have to react and we have to manage the game."
