In his follow-up question during Wednesday's question session with Mabuza, Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen, asked him what he thought of the EFF's "rather bizarre request" to amend the rules that there be fewer of these sessions with the Deputy President. Currently, there is one every month while the House is in session and the EFF proposes that the number be reduced to one a term. Steenhuisen also asked if he met with the EFF about it. EFF Member of Parliament, Natasha Ntlangwini, raised a point of order, saying Steenhuisen should withdraw his "disingenuous question" and rather ask them. But Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said Steenhuisen had the right to ask the question. "The honourable Steenhuisen must just remember that I'm the convenor of Gauteng. We still have Pretoria and Johannesburg," Ntlangweni warned, raising the possibility of also trying to remove those cities' DA-mayors who were in government with the EFF's support. Mabuza, who smiled as he listened to Steenhuisen, answered: "My opinion is, you must understand that members of the executive are, in between (coming to Parliament), responsible for running the affairs of government." He said they must have an opportunity to do their work. "The life of ministers is a very difficult life," he said. "You can have me as many times as you want. I'm not running away," said Mabuza. Steenhuisen then pointed out that Mabuza didn't answer the part of the question about meeting with the EFF.
