Shares of the banks were higher in pre-market trading, but fell soon after the market opened. JPMorgan and Citigroup were down about 0.5 % and Wells Fargo dropped 1.4 %. JPMorgan Chase said net income jumped in the first quarter to $8.7 billion, 35.1 % higher than the year-ago period. Revenues increased 10.3 % to $28.5 billion. The biggest US bank by assets saw increases in all its major divisions due in large part to higher interest rates, which enabled JPMorgan to increase its profits from the spread between its deposits and loans. At Citigroup, first-quarter earnings rose to $4.6 billion, up 13 % from the year-ago period, while revenues were up 2.8 % at $18.9 billion. In corporate and investment banking, JPMorgan notched higher advisory fees, offsetting a drop in debt and equity underwriting fees. Results also got a boost from the $240 million drop in income taxes following US tax reform, as well as the $170 million in reserves released that were connected to a single oil and gas company not specified in a news release. However, JPMorgan's commercial banking business experienced flat lending despite positive corporate sentiment. Chief financial officer Marianne Lake expects lending to pick up as more businesses take action following US tax reform. "As much as we're all eager, we have to recognize that tax reform is still in the early stages," Lake said in a conference call with reporters. "But optimism continues to be very high." Citigroup pointed to broad growth in global consumer banking across regions and lower taxes. But investment banking revenues fell along with bond trading, although equity markets trading revenue saw a 38 % surge amid higher stock market volatility.  --AFP--
