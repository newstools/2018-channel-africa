The United States, Britain and France launched military air strikes on multiple government targets in Syria in the wee hours of Saturday morning, in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of people last week. AU Commission Chairperson, Moussa Faki, asked members of the United Nations Security Council to put aside their differences and pursue global peace. The AU statement follows Algeria's "regret of the airstrikes" and Egypt's condemnation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Meanwhile, Russia says international experts will on Wednesday be allowed in Douma, to investigate the suspected chemical attack in Syria. The International Chemical Weapons watchdog said the Syrian authorities had not allowed access because of what they called security issues. However, a Russian Defence Ministry official, Igor Kirillov, says Russia has not been preventing the team's arrival.
