Trailing 14-0 at halftime they at least had the consolation of outscoring their fellow Africans 10-5 in the second half. The tries came from Mathrin Simmers and Zenay Jordaan. For Kenya there were tries from Janet Okello, Celeat Masinde and Phila Orlando with two conversions from Doreen Remour. South Africa lost their first two games to Canada and New Zealand on Friday. Coach Paul Delportâ€™s side will now play off for positions five to eight on Sunday. --ANA--
