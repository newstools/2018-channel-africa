The Guptas had a lease agreement with Export Development Canada (EDC) and Stoneriver for the Bombadier Global 6000 aircraft but are currently engaged in a legal dispute in UK courts over the agreement. Last month the High Court issued an interim order that the aircraft, with a listing price of $60.5 million, (R731 million), be held at Lanseria pending the outcome of the UK court proceedings. High Court Judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane ordered the plane to be delivered to Lanseria airport along with all appliances, components and necessary equipment within 15 days. Part of the reasons given by Kathree-Setiloane, was that the transponder of the aircraft had been turned off, resulting in the owners having no way to determine where the aircraft was. Earlier this week the Guptas filed for leave to appeal the high court ruling. On Friday night several people tweeted that the aircraft’s transponder had been turned back on, and the aircraft was picked up travelling from Dubai back to South Africa. --news24—
