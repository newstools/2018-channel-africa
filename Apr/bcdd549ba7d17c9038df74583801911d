The three officials of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), including the vice chair, Consolata Nkatha released their statement at a news conference in Nairobi, saying there was a "deterioration in confidence" with the chairperson, Wafula Chebukati. The commission was frequently at the centre of controversy during Kenya's extended election season last year, in which around 100 people were killed. During the process, before a repeat round of voting, Chebukati said he could not guarantee the presidential election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues. Chebukati went on to deliver results for that election, in which President Uhuru Kenyatta won 98% of a vote boycotted by the opposition. Last week, the commission sent its Chief Executive, Ezra Chiloba, on three months' compulsory leave pending an audit, it said, without giving a detailed reason for the move.
