The pace of private-sector loan growth in the 19-nation single currency zone fell to 3.0% year-on-year last month, adjusting for some purely financial transactions, down from 3.1% in February and 3.3% in January. Both households and non-financial firms' uptake of credit both picked up slightly in March, with all of the slowdown coming from non-bank financial firms like insurance companies and pension funds. Credit growth is a vital indicator for the ECB as it hesitates by the exit door from its massive support to the Eurozone. Governors want to be certain the economy is healthy before ending their mass bond-buying programme of $36.4 billion per month, the first step to eventually raising interest rates from their historic lows. Both policy levers are designed to pump cash through the financial system and into the pockets of firms and households, where it can be used for spending and investment to power growth and, indirectly, inflation.
