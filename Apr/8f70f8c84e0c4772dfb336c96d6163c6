The supervisory board of the world's leading automaker will meet a day ahead of schedule and will announce its decisions in a statement, a source close to the company told AFP late on Wednesday. Volkswagen on Tuesday announced it was considering reshuffling its board and replacing Mueller, in a move that sent stocks in the company surging. Mueller had "signalled he was open to play a part in the changes" in conversations with supervisory board chief Hans Dieter Poetsch, the company said in a statement. German business newspaper Handelsblatt and national news agency DPA reported Herbert Diess, head of the VW brand, one of the group's 12 makes of cars, trucks and motorbikes -- was slated to take Mueller's place. Mueller, a former chief executive of sportscar-building VW subsidiary Porsche AG, was brought in to replace Martin Winterkorn in 2015 and was contracted to serve until 2020.Â
