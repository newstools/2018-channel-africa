That's according to United States (US) military officials, speaking on the side-lines of an African Security Summit in Nigeria's commercial capital, Abuja. The US says Boko Haram's tactics, from improvised explosive devices to hiding within the local population, necessitate a shift away from conventional strategies. As America steps up its military presence in Africa, it hopes to share lessons learned in the Middle East with Nigeria and other countries in the Sahel fighting extremist groups. Meanwhile, three Chadian soldiers have been given a posthumous award by the Chadian army chief of staff.Â  They were killed in a clash on Sunday between Boko Haram jihadists and the Multinational Joint Task Force soldiers in Arge in Nigeria's Abadam district, which is on the border with Chad. The Task Force has patrolled the Lake Chad area for several years alongside civilian watch committees to prevent the return of Boko Haram to the region.
