South Africa ran in seven tries for a comfortable 43-0 victory having led 22-0 at half time. Playmaker Justin Geduld scored two tries and kicked two conversions for an individual haul of 14 points while Philip Snyman, Rosko Specman, Branco du Preez, Tim Agaba and Dylan Sage all crossed the whitewash too. South Africa are next in action at 10:37 (SA time) when they take on Papua New Guinea in another pool match they will be expected to win easily. There was more bad news for the SA Women's Sevens side, however, as they fell to their third straight defeat in their pool. Having already been thrashed by Canada and New Zealand on Friday, coach Paul Delport's men then fell to a 17-10 defeat to African rivals Kenya in the early hours of Saturday morning. --news24--
