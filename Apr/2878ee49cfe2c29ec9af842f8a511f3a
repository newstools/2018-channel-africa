The Belgian explained that while Amakhosi have the resources to attract some of the best players in the league, Stars do not have the same pulling power. But Eymael still feels that Ea Lla Koto can compete on an equal footing once the game starts, and in this respect he's pleased to have some experienced campaigners in his ranks. "It is David versus Goliath‚" he told TimesLIVE. "In terms of the players we have‚ the salaries we can pay‚ the players Chiefs can buy with their big budget‚ they have a big advantage with this. "But before each game it is 50-50 and we will try our best. We are obviously very motivated to win‚ the club have not been to the final since 1994 and not won any major competition since that year (when they claimed the Coca-Cola Cup). "We have players like Paulus Masehe‚ Siphelele Mthembu‚ Patrick Phungwayo and Rooi Mahamutsa who have played in cup finals before with other clubs‚ so they know how good it feels to play in a final." The Bethlehem-based club have certainly shown this season that they're scared of no team and going into Saturday night's match in Durban, they are in fifth spot on the league table, three points and one position behind the Glamour Boys. Stars made it to the semi-final stage of the Nedbank Cup in 2008, 2010 and 2012, but have never reached the final of the competition under the current sponsors. Kick-off is at 20:15.
