The 34-year-old Habana is the second-most-capped Springbok of all time with 124 Test caps. Habana played 25 Tests against the All Blacks, who are seen as South Africa's greatest rivals. He was one the winning side in eight of those Tests. The All Blacks, via their official Twitter account, heaped praise on Habana, whom they describe as "one of our greatest rivals": Habana, a Rugby World Cup winner in 2007, made his Test debut against England at Twickenham in November 2004, when he scored the first of his 67 Test tries, the most ever by a Springbok.
