Reports in the New York Times and Financial Times this week said a group of investors had offered the eye-watering amount to buy a revamped and enlarged Club World Cup and rights to a proposed global league for national teams. They said investors from the United States, China, Japan, and the Middle East were among those discussing the proposals. The Club World Cup is an annual event in which seven clubs, usually continental champions, compete in a knock-out format. --Reuters--
