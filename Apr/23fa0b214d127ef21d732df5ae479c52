Cosby’s defense team on Monday sought to undercut the credibility of a woman accusing the comedian of sexual assault by pressing her about accusations she schemed to plant a false story of abuse to reap hush money. Cosby, 80, is undergoing his second trial on charges that he drugged and raped Andrea Constand, 45, at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2014. At the time, she was director of operations for the women’s basketball team at Temple University, the entertainer’s alma mater. The former television star’s first trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. Constand has accused Cosby of attacking her when she visited him to discuss leaving her job. After she consumed three blue pills that he said would relax her, she said she became immobilized and awoke to find Cosby touching her breasts and vagina and using her hand to stroke his penis. Two days of cross examination ended with defense lawyer Tom Mesereau asking Constand if she once roomed with Margo Jackson, who was barred from testifying in the first trial but will be allowed to take the witness stand in the retrial. Jackson has said that Constand once told her on a basketball road trip that she could make a lot of money through a false charge of sexual assault against a celebrity. On Monday, under questioning by Mesereau, Constand denied knowing Jackson, rooming with her or ever speaking to her. Mesereau then said, “Before you filed charges against Mr. Cosby, did you fabricate a scheme?” Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden interrupted with an objection sustained by Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O’Neill. Mesereau tried a second time, slightly altering his statement and again drew a sustained objection.
