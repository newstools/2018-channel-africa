Trump said that he planned to create a 'strong and lasting footprint' in Syria after meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. This comes after the president was forced to put his earlier aim of immediately withdrawing US troops from the war-torn country on hold, while instructing them to prepare to leave in the coming months. Hmaidi al-Abdullah, a Syrian political analyst, said in an interview with China Central Television (CCTV) in Damascus that the US wouldn't easily leave Syria in the short term. "I think maybe only when the Syrian government recovers southern Syria and Idlib Province, it would turn its focus on Raqqa and Al Hasakah where the US troops are. Then the US will face two choices either fight with Syria and its allies or withdraw," he said. Al-Abdullah said that as Trump continues to the increase pressure, the US will not give up control of northern Syrian areas even if Gulf countries dispatch troops. "The US hopes to control the Arab military in order to control the region connecting Iraq, Iran and Syria, and therefore restrain the influence of Iran," said the analyst. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Adel Al-Jubeir, said Saudi Arabia was considering sending troops to support the presence of the US in Syria.Â 

However, al-Abdullah said it was unlikely that the Saudis will contribute troops in Syria as the stalemate in the Yemen crisis continues. "If there was no such a war (in Yemen), Saudi Arabia would send troops to Syria under the pressure of the US. But now, as the Yemen crisis continues, all forces have already formed a balance of power," said al-Abdullah. --Reuters--
