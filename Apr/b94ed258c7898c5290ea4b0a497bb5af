Edin Dzeko opened the scoring after just six minutes as he latched onto a glorious ball over the top from Daniele De Rossi and poked past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Veteran midfielder, De Rossi, added his name to the scoresheet and doubled their lead from the penalty spot on the 58th minute. The Serie A outfit completed the remarkable comeback on the 82nd minute when Kostas Manolas glanced a header at the near post into the back of the net from a corner. As the final whistle was blown, the Roma bench flooded the Stadio Olimpico field as home fans breathed a sigh of relief. Video footage was later released of the players celebrating in the dressing room with Dzeko enjoying the moment with his child as well. The draw for the semi-final will take place on Friday, April 13. --News24--
