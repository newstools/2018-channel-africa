Heavily indebted Mozambique got cut off from multilateral and foreign donors such as the International Monetary Fund after the government admitted to $1.4 billion of previously undisclosed loans in 2016. It presented a restructuring plan to its commercial creditors in March. “We are making dialogue with the creditors and we are looking at what should be done, naturally this is a complex process,” said Nyusi, speaking through a translator at international think tank Chatham House in London. “It is a complex process because it is not only Mozambique to be seen as a culprit, this loan was from a certain place, they were not aware we are just giving this, due diligence should have been done, so this is a responsibility that should be shared,” he added. --Reuters--
