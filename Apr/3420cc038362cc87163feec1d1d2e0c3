The President says he hopes to build on an already solid relationship between the two countries. Ramaphosa says he had a good chat with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday morning.

May welcomed the South African leader to Downing Street, noting it was his first visit since taking office. She said she looked forward to working with him during the Commonwealth Heads of Government who meet in the British capital this week. Ramaphosa will discuss how the two countries can deepen their ties in education, culture and trade. He also mentioned his delegation would be working hard to promote South Africa’s newly launched investment drive looking to raise $100 billion over five years. His first port of call was a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. On Tuesday night he will address a banquet held by the Commonwealth Business Forum. The President’s office says the forum involving leaders from around the world will be an opportunity for South Africa to promote investments opportunities, lobby for South Africa’s candidature to the United Nations Security Council in 2017 and promote the centenary of the birth of the late President, Nelson Mandela. --SABC-- Click video below:
