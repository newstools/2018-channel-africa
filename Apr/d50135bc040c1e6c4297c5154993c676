The measures were announced by the president's office late Monday, two days after a rally in which Bio, a former general who was briefly in power in the 1990s, said he would be a stickler for "discipline." "A National Cleaning Day is declared and scheduled for the first Saturday of each month, from 7:00 am to 12:00 noon," it said in a statement. "The first National Cleaning Day scheduled by the ministry of health affairs is Saturday, May 5." 

Bio added that all civil servants and government ministers were expected to be at work from 8:30 am until 4:45 pm, and he and the vice president would carry out snap checks. "Failure to report for work on time will lead to disciplinary action and potential summary dismissal," the statement said. 

A monthly National Cleaning Day in which public areas are cleaned of rubbish, trees planted and walls repainted, was brought in during the 1992-1996 junta led by Captain Valentine Strasser, who was overthrown by Bio, then his deputy. The monthly cleanup was restored from time to time by following regimes. In another move, Bio said businesses would be allowed to open on Sundays from this week. Sunday trading had been interrupted by the 2014-16 Ebola crisis. Bio took office last week after a tumultuous election campaign, ending a decade-long rule by the All People's Congress (APC). He won 51.81 % of the vote in the second-round runoff against the APC's champion, Samura Kamara. --AFP--
