Tshisekedi, who was appointed as leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) last month, is one of two main figures expected to seek to run in the election. Exiled businessman, Moise Katumbi, is the other. Surrounded by a crowd of cheering supporters, Tshisekedi dismissed speculation he might accept the post of Prime Minister, something Kabila has offered in the past to appease opponents. Kabila's opposition is weak and divided. Many opposition politicians joined a power-sharing government after the death of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, Felix's father, last year. Dozens have died in protests, most shot dead by security forces, since Kabila refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate in December 2016. But Tuesday's rally was unusual in that it was permitted, watched closely by armed police. The rally came days after an accord was signed to set up a committee to organise the repatriation of Etienne Tshisekedi's body from Belgium, where he died more than 14 months ago. His body was prevented from returning following disputes about where he should be buried. In the latest deal it was agreed his body would lie in stated for a week before burial in a family estate. --Reuters--
