Pep Guardiola's side won the league with five games to spare, but in a manner most unexpected following a slip-up by their city rivals. United denied the Citizens from being coronated at the Etihad Stadium last weekend as they fought back from two goals down to claim a shock 3-2 win in the 176th Manchester derby. However, the Red Devils handed the title to City in tame fashion after Jay Rodriguez clinched a rare victory for the rock-bottom Baggies with his 73rd-minute header. Guardiola conquered England in only his second season at Eastlands, with his team having lost just twice in 33 matches and went unbeaten in the top flight until January 14 when Liverpool ended that amazing run at Anfield. The Spaniard has also won the domestic double after guiding the club to victory in the EFL Cup with a 3-0 win over Arsenal in the final on February 25. City captain Vincent Kompany watched the United-West Brom match at home with his family while his father in-law, a Manchester United fan, was present as the Red Devils slipped up. Later that evening, the 32-year-old met up with a few City players at a local pub to celebrate triumph and was then caught on video giving an inspiring speech. "If there are kids in the room, cover their ears or send them out,‚Äù Kompany said. "It's been a long journey. Especially if you have been a Blue for more than 40 years in your heart. "But tonight - we win it again! So, let's celebrate together. Come on!"
