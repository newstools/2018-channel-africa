The New York-based rights group reported that it had confirmed 19 cases of abuse since the 12th of December, "all apparently to press Burundians to vote yes on the referendum" that is scheduled for May 17. State agents and members of a violent youth group that allied with the ruling party, the Imbonerakure, have used repression to ensure the vote goes in the president's favour, and their victims include a man who was beaten to death and another whose beating may have resulted in his death, the group said in its report. "There is little doubt that the upcoming referendum will be accompanied by more abuses," said Ida Sawyer, Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch. "Burundian officials and the Imbonerakure are carrying out violence with near-total impunity to allow the President to entrench his hold on power." Burundi's government didn't immediately respond to the rights group's new allegations, but in the past it has repeatedly denied charges of rights abuses, dismissing them as propaganda spread by exiles. Burundi has been plagued by violence since April 2015, when deadly protests broke out after President Pierre Nkurunziza sought a third term, leaving an estimated 1 200 people dead. More than 400 000 people have fled the country. The International Criminal Court judges last year authorised an investigation into allegations of state-sponsored crimes during the recent political upheaval in the East African nation that the United Nations human rights chief has called one of "the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times." In the upcoming referendum Burundians will say yes or no to a proposal to extend the President's term from five years to seven, which means Nkurunziza could rule for another 14 years when his current term expires in 2020. --AP--
