Ibrahimovic signed with the LA Galaxy in March and made his debut on March 31, scoring two goals to complete a 4-3 win over LAFC while earning honors as MLS Player of the Week. The Swedish striker continued his hot start in MLS by scoring the game-winner last weekend in Chicago. Upon his arrival in LA, the 36-year-old took out a full-page ad in the LA Times, it simply read: "Dear Los Angeles, You're welcome...Zlatan Ibrahimovic." A taken-aback Kimmel admitted to the Swede that it was rather unusual the reaction that he had received since arriving in Los Angeles with the live audience clearly fixated by Ibrahimovic's larger-than-life personality. The former Manchester United striker told Kimmel that prospect of playing in LA had been on his mind for a while, he wanted to give the city a gift. And then it came to him, "I should give myself." --News24--
