Kenya Power is state-controlled and it is the sole electricity distributor and the bulk of its power comes from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen). The commission, which is the independent regulator for the sector, sets tariffs for Kenya Power. Energy Minister, Charles Keter, whose ministry is represented on the board of Kenya Power, told a news conference that the company was ready to be audited. “We are open for any scrutiny from any quarter.” A group of Kenyan electricity consumers filed a class action lawsuit against Kenya Power in January, saying that their monthly bills jumped, some tripling, in the second half of last year. A court hearing is set for May. --Reuters--
