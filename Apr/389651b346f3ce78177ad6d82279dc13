The Spain international has established himself as the best shot-stopper in the world during his time at the Red Devils and his performances this term have been nothing short of spectacular. De Gea narrowly missed out on the Golden Glove in the last two years, but a career-best 17 clean sheets in 34 Premier League appearances sees him in pole position to win the accolade this time around. The 27-year-old is the only keeper in the club's history to be named Player of the Year and the first player to be awarded the honour three times in a row. Asked in an interview with Premier League Productions whether the 2017/18 campaign was his finest to date, De Gea replied: "Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with my performance. It's been a fairly complete, all-round set of performances from me. I've felt good, felt fit and in good form physically throughout the season. "Let's hope that these last few games to go before the end of the season continue the form, then leading into the World Cup, which is an important time for Spain." De Gea further stated that manager Jose Mourinho has been key in getting the best out of the United players. "We've got a great manager," he said. "He's very experienced, he's won everything there is to win in the game. What he is really good at is transmitting his winning mentality to the group. "However, at the end of the day, it's down to ourselves, the players on the field. It is us who make the saves, create the chances and score the goals. So, as a group, we've got to get that level of consistency and quality throughout the season." United are back in action on Sunday, April 28 against Arsenal.
