A total of 257 people were killed in the crash, with witnesses saying they saw a wing catch fire shortly after the plane took off. The plane crash has been confirmed by the Defense Ministry as the worst air disaster in the history of Algeria, killing all on board including 10 crew members. --Reuters--
