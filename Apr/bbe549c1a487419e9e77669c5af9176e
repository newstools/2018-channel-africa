The room was prepared on the second floor of the House of Peace in the South Korean side of the truce village of Panmunjom. The venue was originally used for ministerial meetings, so the entire building has been refurnished to greet the two leaders, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The room has an oval-shaped table at the center and head chairs for Moon and Kim who will be sitting across each other and several other chairs for officials. Also a drawing of North Korea's Mount Kumgang was hanging on the wall. Moon and Kim will sit down at the Panmunjom on Friday to discuss a range of issues, including North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The inter-Korean talks and a planned meeting between Kim and US President, Donald Trump, in the coming weeks have raised hopes of an easing in tensions on the peninsula that reached a crescendo last year amid a flurry of North Korean missile tests and its largest nuclear test. The diplomatic overtures are hoped, as a war veteran said, to allow the two sides to "forgive a little".
