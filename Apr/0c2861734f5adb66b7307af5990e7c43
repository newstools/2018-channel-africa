According to NewsDay, Presidential Spokesperson, George Charamba, said that a televised presidential debate between the two leading contestants was unlikely as his boss would not entertain such an idea. Chamisa last month challenged Mnangagwa to a presidential debate, claiming he would expose the president's lack of appreciation for critical issues, said a report by The Zimbabwe Mail. But Charamba said there were many ways that his boss would get the public's attention but a political debate with his main rival was not one of them. "I don't think we are likely to get it (presidential debate) at all because we don't find any value at all. One key component in political communication is to go straight to the voter and they are many ways of doing it outside a presidential debate," Charamba was quoted as saying. Charamba said that Mnangagwa would not be "lulled" into exposing his election strategy by the opposition. In response, Chamisa's Spokesperson, Luke Tamborinyoka, slammed Mnangagwa's refusal to take part in the debate, saying that he (Mnangagwa) remained in the "analogue" era and had not embraced trends in the world of civilisation. --News24--
