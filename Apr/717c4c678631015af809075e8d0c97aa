The Reds claimed an impressive 5-1 aggregate victory against the slumping Citizens despite falling behind early to Gabriel Jesus' strike. 

However, leading comfortably 3-0 from the first leg at Anfield, Mohamed Salah's 39th goal in a spectacular campaign handed Liverpool the ascendancy before Roberto Firmino put the tie to bed. "We scored five against Man City and only conceded one. 

These numbers are usually not possible," expressed Klopp with his side's efforts. "The boys found a solution in the second half. We had two or three opportunities in the first half already, so it was easy for me and the boys to see the development of the game. We had come through the whirlwind." Meanwhile, with Barcelona crashing out at the hands of Roma on away goals after a 4-4 draw in Italy, the German said the semi-final stages could offer up some unexpected possibilities. "I walked up the stairs and somebody told me. I thought it was a joke. Not to disrespect Roma. They lost Salah and are in the semis. That's something else," said the Reds manager. "This competition is quite fair and I really think a normal final would have been Manchester City against Barcelona, and now they are both out. "But there will still be two other really strong teams in there plus Roma and us. We will see what happens but that's not the thing I have to think about right now." The semi-final draw will take place on Friday, April 13. --News24--
