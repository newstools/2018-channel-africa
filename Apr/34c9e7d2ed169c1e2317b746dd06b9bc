Campbell was speaking at Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral service at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Saturday. Campbell described Mama Winnie as a major figure in the anti-apartheid movement. “She was the eyes and ears of the world during those dark days. Without her we wouldn’t know the struggles and what he was going through. She was always striving for equality and to keep South Africa at the forefront in people’s thoughts. Winnie of course made many personal sacrifices including her own imprisonment, house arrest and surveillance that never ever did she waiver in her conviction and her courage.”
