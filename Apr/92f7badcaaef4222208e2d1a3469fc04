Acording to Ghana Web, there is a heavy military and police presence to guard the political party elections, which are currently being held in a classroom, to avert any clashes between constituency chairperson Alhaji Moro and some of the delegates. Kusi Electoral Area branch women’s organiser, Abena Evans, and chairperson Kwasi Adu have asked their supporters not to take part in the voting. Speaking in an interview with Prime News Ghana, Evans said Moro had not opened nominations for all interested parties to pick their forms to contest the branch elections. She added, however, that they had spotted some people sharing and signing the nomination forms, indicating that the elections were going ahead. Evans said some NDC members who were not in favour of the chairman’s steps told him what he was doing was unconstitutional and so the elections should not be held. However, the chairman insisted on voting going ahead hence the decision to parade a heavy police and military presence at the venue. While Morro has denied the allegations, Kusi Electoral Area Chairman, Kwasi Adu explained that voting was underway and some aggrieved members who were not given the opportunity to pick forms to contest the elections were ready to provoke unrest.
