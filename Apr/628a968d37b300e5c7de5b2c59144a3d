Jaafari told the United Nations Security Council that Syria did not possess any chemical weapons and condemned their use. Syria blamed Israel for an attack by unidentified war planes on a Syrian air base near Homs on Monday that killed at least 14 people, including Iranian personnel. "The government of the Syrian Arab Republic condemns in the strongest terms the ruthless Israeli aggression that took place this morning on the airport in Homs governorate, killing and injuring a number of civilians," Jaafari said. "This aggression would not have occurred were it not for the unlimited and consistent support by the American administration to Israel," he added. The suspected chemical weapons attack late on Saturday killed at least 60 people, with more than 1 000 injured in several sites in Douma, according to a Syrian aid organisation. Two days later, the White House was still only able to say that the attack fit the pattern of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapon use. Speaking to reporters after the UNSC meeting, Russian UN Vassily Nebenzia said the evidence on the ground does not support the allegations made about the chemical attack. "There were no dead bodies found. There were no poisoned people in the hospitals. The doctors in Duma denied that there were people who came to the hospital claiming that they were under the chemical attack," Nebenzia said. International bodies led by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) were trying to establish exactly what happened in Douma, a rebel-held town in the eastern Ghouta district.
