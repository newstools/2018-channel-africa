After appearing at the New York Stock Exchange earlier in the day, Reed climbed to the top of the Empire State Building to pose for photographs donning his green jacket, the symbol of Augusta National, awarded to the champion of the Masters Tournament. The Texan said that he defeated another foe, his fear of heights, for the tour around New York that he described as a "dream come true after his one-stroke victory over Rickie Fowler on Sunday. "The first person I thought of was my wife," Reed told Reuters about his moment of victory. "Everything kind of fell in place, and to be able to say that my first major was my sixth win it is my wife's favorite number. It just couldn't have played out any better for me," he said. He also added that his daughter watched the tournament and was waiting for him after the ceremony, welcoming him with a "big hug." "It really puts in perspective that even though I did such a great thing on winning golf, family comes first." The 27-year-old said that he will go back home and let the victory sink in for a few days, but said that he will be back on the fairway soon. "That feeling that you have from winning your first Major, and that adrenaline rush you have it's something that is addictive and you want to get back to it," he said. --Reuters--
