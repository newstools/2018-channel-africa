A rally in zinc prices to their highest since 2007 has helped to boost the overall profits of Vedanta, which has zinc projects in India, South Africa and Namibia. Vedanta Chairperson Anil Agarwal said that demand for zinc and prices of the metal would remain high because there were only three major producers in the world. “It is very difficult to find zinc deposits,” Agarwal told Reuters during his visit to Zambia. Agarwal said that steelmakers were increasingly using zinc to galvanise the construction metal against rust. The global zinc market deficit narrowed to 48 600 tons in December from a revised deficit of 65 700 tons in November, data from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) showed on February 20. Zinc demand will remain high because it is also being used increasingly in other areas, such as the pharmaceuticals industry, Agarwal said. “I see zinc is still going to be a very important material,” Agarwal said. Vedanta could accelerate expansion of its African zinc operations to take advantage of strong prices, it said in February. --Reuters--
