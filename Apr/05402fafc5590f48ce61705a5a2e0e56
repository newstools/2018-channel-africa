South African High commissioner to Kenya Anita Koleka Mqulwana hailed African governments for standing by South Africa during the struggle years. She called on leaders on the continent to dedicate their lives to service as South African struggle icons Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu did.

President Cyril Ramaphosa also delivered his keynote address at the main Freedom Day celebration, being held at a packed Molemela stadium Â in Bloemfontein, in the Free State province. Ramaphosa urged South Africans to use Freedom Day to intensify the struggle for economic freedom for all. He touched on the growing role of women and other advances in South Africa's democracy, which turns 24 years old. Ramaphosa said however there is still so much that needs to be done to improve the lives of South Africans.
