"Sometimes they say, 'Why don't you take a week off?' I joke back and say, 'If you pay me some disappearance fee, I might.' But I haven't received any yet," Langer said on Monday while previewing the Senior PGA Championship in Benton Harbour, Michigan. Leave it to Langer's son to arrange that. Langer revealed that he won't be able to defend his title on May 24-27 because his youngest son, 18-year-old Jason, is graduating from high school that weekend. "Family always comes first in my life, so I've got to be there to support him, to celebrate him moving on to college," Langer said. He said his son will attend Penn's Wharton School of Business and plans to play golf. "I wouldn't want to miss that," Langer said. "I'm going to miss competing for this, but hopefully, there will be more chances in the future." Langer won last year at Trump National outside Washington to complete the career Grand Slam on the 50-and-older circuit. A year ago, Phil Mickelson sat out the US Open at Erin Hills when his oldest daughter graduated from high school. Corey Pavin nearly had the same conflict in 2005 for the US Open at Pinehurst No 2, but he flew cross-country after his opening round on Thursday and caught a redeye back to North Carolina for his second round.
