Largely considered the greatest athletes of all time, the 31-year-old Bolt retired after last year's IAAF World Championships. The world record holder in the 100m and 200m events, Bolt has been in Australia partying up a storm while watching the Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast. And, on Saturday, he took to Twitter after watching Jamaica finish third in the 4x100m men's relay while South Africa claimed silver. Bolt is not used to seeing Jamaica struggle on the international sprinting stage. He won the 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold at three consecutive Olympic Games, and watching his country struggle in Australia may have forced him into a rethink. Bolt took to Twitter on Saturday to set social media alight with rumours of a possible comeback. --afp--
