The violence that erupted on Wednesday has led to a complete lockdown of the provincial capital. It was sparked earlier this week by local communities demanding that Premier Supra Mahumapelo be recalled. The President was attending a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London. Meanwhile, the opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West says it welcomes and appreciates Ramaphosa's initiative of cutting short his visit to the United Kingdom to come to the province. DA leader, Joe Macgluwa, says: "We welcome the decision for the president to come here and we would like to say that we hope this is not a PR stance. The Premier must just be recalled by the President, we appreciate the fact that he cancels his trip.Â 

"We are saying yes we believe and we hope the only one thing and that is to solve the problems of this province and that is to recall Mahumapelo."
