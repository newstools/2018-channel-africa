Teachers threatened to join the nurses' strike in solidarity after a unilateral decree by the Vice President Constentino Chiwenga to dismiss all striking nurses. However, a resolution was made on Friday that if government employs the militant conduct to the affairs of teachers, then they would strike, depriving school children quality education. Last week, a decision by the Zimbabwean government to fire 16 000 striking nurses backfired and could spill into an untenable labour row. A day after nurses downed tools demanding an address of a series of grievances, Chiwenga issued a decree firing all striking nurses, without following labour procedures.
