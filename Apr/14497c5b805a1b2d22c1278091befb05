Karadzic, 72, was sentenced to four decades behind bars in 2016 for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, arising from the Balkan country's three-year war which killed 100 000 people and left 2.2 million others homeless. The former strongman with his recognisable bouffant hairdo was "at the apex of political and military structures" of the Bosnian Serb leadership and "at the forefront of developing and promoting its ideologies", judges said at his sentencing in March 2016. They found Karadzic guilty on 10 counts, including one of genocide for masterminding the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, deemed the worst bloodshed on European soil since World War II. Almost 8 000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered and their bodies dumped in mass graves after battle-hardened Bosnian Serb soldiers overran a protected "safe area" guarded by lightly-armed Dutch United Nations (UN) peacekeepers. Judges also found him guilty of being behind the bitter 44-month siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, in which 10 000 civilians died in a relentless campaign of sniping and shelling. But Karadzic was acquitted on one count of genocide, with judges saying there was not enough evidence to prove "beyond reasonable doubt" that genocide was also committed in seven Bosnian towns and villages. Karadzic appealed on 50 grounds and accused judges of conducting a "political trial" against him, while prosecutors said the trial judges "erred in law and fact", asking that their original demand for a life sentence be reinstated. His lawyer, Peter Robinson, said Karadzic did not get a fair trial as the UN judges "presumed him guilty and then constructed a judgement to justify its presumption." --AFP--
