Losses by the tech sector in Asia and profit-taking among mining stocks in Europe contributed to the overall losses. The index is still on track for a 1% gain this week, as global markets recover from a turbulent first quarter which saw the return of volatility, trade tensions between the United States and China, and tensions in the Middle East. "Our base case is that investor focus will shift back to economic growth as some of the current uncertainties ease," UBS strategists wrote in a note to clients. "In our base case we do not expect current tensions between NATO and Russia to escalate further than issues in the past, such as Crimea, and expect the trade dispute between the US and China to be negotiated without escalating to a trade war."

Shares in Europe were down 0.2%, but remain up half a percent on the week and set for their fourth straight week of gains.
