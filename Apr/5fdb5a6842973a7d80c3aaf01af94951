Accused of wanting to muzzle the media, the former footballer-turned-politician has attempted to reassure journalists saying they would have a "200% freedom of expression and press freedom under my government".

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), however, has expressed concern over the $1.8 million in defamation suits against Front Page Africa, a Liberian newspaper that has carried critical coverage of successive governments. "Liberia has a troubling history of libel lawsuits where applicants ask for exorbitant damages simply to harass and intimidate journalists, resulting in their imprisonment or the closure of news outlets," said Angela Quintal, CPJ Africa programme coordinator. "The government should move swiftly to reform Liberia's libel laws to guard against their abuse in this way," Quintal added. During a visit to Monrovia in March, the United Nation's rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye expressed concern over the consequences of large financial penalties in civil libel suits against Liberian journalists and newspapers. The Ministry of Information has denied any government involvement in the law suits against Front Page Africa which relate to a private dispute following the publication of an advertisement. But the newspaper's management and the CPJ blame the situation on its criticism of those in power, highlighting the presence among the complainants of a former member of Weah's party and the absence of legal action against other media outlets. In another media drama, the BBC's correspondent Jonathan Paye-Layleh left the country saying he feared reprisals by supporters of the president after Weah accused him of being against him. "My fears go beyond the possibility of the president ordering my arrest some day and formally unsealing the indictment that he has already hinted Â by his verbal attack," Paye-Layleh said in a message to colleagues.
