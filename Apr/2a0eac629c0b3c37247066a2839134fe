Hundreds of people are still forcing their way into the packed stadium. The 36 000 capacity stadium is packed with mourners dressed in colourful political parties regalia. Government spokesperson Phumla Williams has pleaded with those outside the stadium to go to the nearby overflow venue which is a rugby stadium. Williams says: “As government we would like to thank people for coming in great numbers. However we would like to request those outside to go to the rugby stadium because the current capacity of Orlando stadium is full.” “There are screens and they will be able to follow proceedings from that stadium.”
