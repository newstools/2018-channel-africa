Earlier, Hong Kong led a rally across most Asian markets as traders brushed off a slowdown in the US economy, while the boost from last week's historic North-South Korea summit continued to support Seoul and the won. "A genuinely game-changing deal in the supermarket sector was the main highlight" for London's benchmark FTSE 100 index, said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. Britain's second and third biggest supermarket chains Sainsbury's and Walmart-owned Asda have agreed to merge, the pair said Monday, hoping to create $18 billion retail king and leapfrog UK number one Tesco. Sainsbury's stock shot up 17 % in London midday deals, while Tesco was down 0.4 %. Asda is not listed. Investors across the globe meanwhile continued to react to data Friday that showed US growth had slowed in January-March. Despite the update, tech firms on Wall Street won pre-weekend support after healthy earnings figures from Amazon, Microsoft and Intel. The positive lead from New York provided some much-needed help Monday to Asian tech firms, which had been hammered in recent weeks by worries about the lucrative smartphone market. Hong Kong-listed AAC Technologies and Tencent each posted healthy gains, while in Taipei Apple suppliers TSMC was also sharply higher. On broader markets Hong Kong ended 1.7-% higher, with a better-than-forecast Chinese factory activity reading also providing support as it eased concerns about a slowdown in the mainland economy. Seoul added 0.9 % while Sydney gained 0.5 %. Tokyo and Shanghai were closed for public holidays. South Korean traders remain upbeat after Friday's meeting between President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un, which fuelled hopes for peace on the peninsula and for Pyongyang's possible denuclearisation.  --AFP--
