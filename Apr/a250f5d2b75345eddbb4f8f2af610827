The price of petrol will rise by 49 cents to R14.97 ($1.21) per litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while diesel will go up by as much 59 cents to R13.34 ($1.07). The Central Energy Fund said in a statement that the depreciation of the Rand against the Dollar in past month as well as a higher oil price globally had contributed to the rise in local fuel prices. --Reuters--
