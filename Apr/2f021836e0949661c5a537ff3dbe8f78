Pirates came from a goal down to beat a determined AmaZulu to move three points behind log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. The Buccaneers are on 49 points with only three games remaining, with the Brazilians sitting on 52 points having a single game in hand. The homeside broke the deadlock in the 11th minute through veteran Mabhuti Khenyeza after launching a counter attack. Musa Nyatama equalised with a header from the resultant free kick 12 minutes before the break. Substitute Thabo Qalinge scored the winner for Pirates 11 minutes from time.
