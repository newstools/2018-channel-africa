Snapping a four-day winning streak, spot gold fell 0.8% to $1,341.50 an ounce by 1226 GMT. US gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,349.20. The Dollar index gained 0.3%, dragging down commodities priced in the US currency. “It’s looking like profit-taking,” said ING commodities strategist Oliver Nugent, adding that support from geopolitical tensions was not enough to bring gold back above $1 350. Underpinning bullion was news that British ministers planned to gather on Thursday to discuss whether to join the United States and France in possible military action in Syria that could bring direct confrontation between Western and Russian forces. US President, Donald Trump, on Wednesday warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria over a suspected gas attack, declaring that missiles “will be coming” and lambasting Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Gold is often used as a store of value during times of financial or political uncertainty, generally gaining along with assets such as the Japanese yen and US Treasuries. “Expectations are that $1 350 will act as an initial pivot point for near-term pricing,” said MKS SA precious metals trader Sam Laughlin. “However, more importantly, key downside support around $1 335 to $1 340 should provide a base for a further test through the January high of $1 366.” Also supporting gold were lingering worries about a trade war between China and the United States. The US economy was displaying signs of strength, minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting showed on Wednesday, increasing the likelihood of higher interest rates. A tightening in US monetary policy dents the investment appeal of gold because the metal pays no interest. --Reuters--
