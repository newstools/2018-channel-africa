More refugees are expected to arrive, driven by a surge in fighting between Peul and Dogon communities in Mali’s Mopti region, said a spokespersonn for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). The influx is putting pressure on vulnerable host communities in Burkina Faso’s north, which is facing its worst hunger in years coupled with growing violence, aid agencies said. "We think that the influx of new asylum-seekers might aggravate the situation," UNHCR Spokesperson, Marlies Cardoen, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Poor rains last year have left almost a million people in need of food aid in Burkina Faso, while attacks by a homegrown Islamist group are on the rise. The new arrivals, including 2 000 Malians and 1 000 Burkinabe who had settled in Mali, are mostly staying with friends and relatives in volatile, hard-to-reach areas near the border, said UNHCR. "We want them to come to Ouahigouya (the nearest town) or the refugee camp where we can register them all and give them food aid," said Cardoen by phone. But some prefer to remain in the border area because they are expecting family to join them, hope to go home soon, or do not know of other options, she said. While 3 000 people will not make a big difference on a national scale, it could have an impact in host communities, said Christian Munezero, head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
