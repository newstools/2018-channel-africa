Chief executive Andrew Mackenzie, said strong performance in copper had been underpinned by its Los Colorados Extension project and higher utilisation rates at Pampa Norte. This more than offset the slower than expected ramp-up of Olympic Dam during the quarter following planned smelter maintenance. "Incremental improvements across our operations from debottle-necking and increased throughput delivered record production in iron ore," Mackenzie said. "Our exit from Onshore US is progressing to plan with bids expected by June 2018." BHP's full year production guidance remains unchanged for petroleum, metallurgical coal and energy coal.
