Dikwena, who are at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table, shrugged off Polokwane City with a 2-0 win at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on Saturday night. It was a crucial win for De Sa's side as they revived their survival hopes. An elated De Sa wants his charges to raise the bar again when they face Kaizer Chiefs this weekend. "I just hope we can learn from this win and put up another four good performances like the one on Saturday. It was a massive performance. "I thought all 11 players were out there doing their jobs. Everybody played well. Whatever I asked of them, everybody contributed. It was fantastic to see that. It was a really gutsy performance. I am very happy in general.The performance was good. That’s where it started," said De Sa. After the match, Dikwena players were in high spirits thanks to goals by Gerald Phiri and Bongi Ntuli. Though Dikwena were in a celebratory mood, De Sa was quick to remind his men of the next challenge that lies ahead. 

De Sa wants his men to build from their latest win. "We play Kaizer Chiefs away and that is going to be a very difficult task. It’s good for us that we won, but we are going to face a wounded Chiefs which is not going to be easy. I think Chiefs will roll their sleeves up and they are going to come out to fight. When Chiefs are good they are really good and we have probably got to be even better than we were against Polokwane City. Hopefully we can put on another good performance," said De Sa.
