The appeal application was made in December when Zuma was still President. 

The Economic Freedom Fighters, the Democratic Alliance, the United Democratic Movement and the Council for the Advancement of South African Constitution argued for the matter to be dismissed with costs.

Their stance came after the Presidency's legal team filed for a complete withdrawal of the matter which carries legal costs of about R10 million. 

However, the Presidency argued that Zuma should be afforded recourse to pursue the application in his private capacity if he so wishes.
