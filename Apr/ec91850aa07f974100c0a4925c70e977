Jordaan insisted in a prepared statement, released through his attorneys, that allegations made by Jennifer Ferguson for an alleged incident that happened more than 20 years ago were "unfounded". Jordaan has been accused of rape by Ferguson who is a former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament. Full statement below: It is almost a month since we learnt in a press report that Jennifer Ferguson has laid a complaint against Dr Danny Jordaan about an alleged incident more than 20 years ago. Despite numerous attempts to contact authorities including two letters directed to the South African Police Service, we have been unable to determine any information about the whereabouts of the docket. The lack of information is damaging to our client. As Dr Jordaan's attorneys, we have attempted to engage the SAPS and the investigating  officer in this matter and will soon contact the National Prosecuting Authority in an attempt to have the matter dealt with as soon as reasonably possible. We reiterate that Ms Ferguson’s allegations are absolutely unfounded and untrue and that her true motives are deeply suspect. Yours Mohlala Attorneys SAFA previously confirmed at a press conference that the National Executive Committee fully supports Jordaan and that he is innocent until proven guilty. --News24--
