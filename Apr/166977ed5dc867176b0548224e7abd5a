The militants regularly took youngsters to spread fear and show power, the agency said on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, a case that triggered global outrage. UNICEF spokesperson Christophe Boulierac said more than 1000 verified cases had been documented, the first time it had published an estimated tally. But the actual number could be much larger, he added. Boko Haram remains a charged issue politically. President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 rose to power on promises to end the insurgency. But his administration has failed to defeat Boko Haram, despite pushing the militants out of many towns in the northeast by 2016.  --Reuters--
