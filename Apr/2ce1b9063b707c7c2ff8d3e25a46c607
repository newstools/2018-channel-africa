Despite the losses the Rand looks set to carve out gains this week with long term bets still based on global synchronised growth, a positive scenario for emerging market currencies. “Market positioning, as reflected by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicates a high conviction in the current ‘narrative’, i.e. that global synchronized growth will continue,” said Nedbank analysts Mehul Daya and Walter de Wet in a note. The analysts also said implied volatility across most of the maturity buckets had fallen, reflecting lower domestic risks. Bonds were also weaker, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 adding 8.085%. The stock market was set to open flat at 0700 GMT, with the Top40 futures index down only 0.04%. --Reuters--
