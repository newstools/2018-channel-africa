Pochettino has not had the same luxuries at Spurs, but is adamant his team will remain competitive in the new season. City clinched the league title a day after they beat Pochettino's side 3-1 at Wembley, which was confirmed when Manchester United lost 1-0 at home to West Brom on Sunday. Despite trailing the newly-crowned champions by 20 points with five games remaining in the season, Pochettino told Sky Sports: "I am not concerned. "Yes of course if they invest money and bring in players that can improve their squad, of course they are sure to compete to be the best team in the Premier League again. "Today my concern is to try to win on Tuesday, after that I am not thinking about what Man City is going to do. It is nothing to worry about because it is still so far until next season." Pochettino said Spurs have different goals to the Citizens, their target is to qualify for the UEFA Champions League again while finishing second will be a bonus. "We believe we are capable of beating any side," he added. "We think we are going to be competitive, challenge for big things, then we need to start from day one and pre-season in a different way." --News24--
