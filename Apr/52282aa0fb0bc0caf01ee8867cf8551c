CSA and Cricket Australia (CA) jointly released the itinerary for the Proteas' tour to Australia towards the end of the year.
 
The Proteas will play three ODIs in addition to a single T20 International match. The Proteas will play at one new venue with the T20 International being played on the Gold Coast. "We now have a concentrated programme of 21 ODIs, 13 at home and 8 away, ahead of the World Cup," commented CSA Acting Chief Executive, Thabang Moroe. “This will give the National Selection Panel and the Proteas team management time first to finalise our squad of 15 players to bid for that elusive trophy and then every opportunity to fine tune their game plan accordingly. 

"I would also like to stress that the other two formats, Test cricket and T20 International cricket, also feature strongly on our list over the next year with seven Test matches to be played against Sri Lanka and Pakistan and 10 T20 International matches to be played against Australia, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Sri Lanka."
