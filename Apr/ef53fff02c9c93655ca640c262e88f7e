Erasmus has taken over the reins from Allister Coetzee, who was ousted at the end of a second disappointing international season in 2017. With a Test against Wales and three against England coming up in June, Erasmus has been at work looking to implement his turnaround strategy for the national team. He has assembled his coaching staff, and last week it was confirmed that De Bruin would be helping out the Boks as an attacking consultant in June. Erasmus has also been visiting the Super Rugby franchises and conducting alignment camps along the way, and De Bruin has been impressed by what he seen so far. "What Rassie has started here is wonderful," he said from Johannesburg on Tuesday ahead of his side's trip to Australasia. "He's got a total relationship with the franchises. There is constant communication, we speak to them and they speak to us about resting players and not resting players. It's absolutely a step in the right direction. "Rassie is a real rugby guy and he will do well for this country, I know that." With the Lions struggling to find the dominance they had under previous coach Johan Ackermann, De Bruin has his hands full. "100% my focus at this stage is still on the Lions, I'm still contracted until next year," he said. "Rassie will be using me totally when we have that break in June, that's when Iâ€™ll be involved. Obviously we do talk and communicate, but I just want to assure everyone that my focus is 100% on the Lions. When I go there, then my focus will be 100% on the Springboks." --News24--
