The South African champions enjoyed some early chances through veteran winger Daine Klate but were denied by some last-ditch defending. The Clever Boys started positively and went close when Daine Klate volleyed just over from a flick-on by Eleazar Rodgers. Not long after, the Nigerian outfit showed great alertness as an attempt by Klate was cleared off the line. Nonetheless, the People's Elephant were close to taking the advantage as Chinonso Okonkwo found a pocket of space but failed to hit the target. It was end-to-end stuff and Ike Ibenegbu came close as his half-volley tested Peters and the rebound dropped to Abdulrahman Bashir, but he fired wide. After the interval, Bongani Khumalo's header came close, although Fatau Dauda produced a solid save. The action was heating up and Freedom Omofoman may have done better as he dragged a strike wide from a fine pass from Bashir. The hosts were boosted when Edwin Gyimah saw red for a rough foul on Austin Oladapo, with just over 20 minutes to go. In the closing stages, Rodgers came within inches of winning the tie for the visitors, but he was just unable to connect with a cross from Thobani Mncwango. At the death, Omofoman was pulled down in the box for a penalty, but Peters produced a fine save with Anaemena hitting the side-netting on the follow-up attempt. --News24--
