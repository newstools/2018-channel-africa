Feds reportedly confiscated emails, tax documents and records on a range of topics, including a $130 000 payment made by Cohen to keep porn star Stormy Daniels quiet about a sexual encounter she alleges she had with President Trump. "It's a disgrace. It's frankly a real disgrace. It's an attack on our country in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for. So when I saw this, when I heard it, I heard it like you did, I said 'that is really now in a whole new level of unfairness." Cohen's lawyer saying that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had obtained the search warrant after receiving a referral from the office of special counsel Robert Mueller. Cohen's team adding that Cohen had cooperated with authorities and turned over thousands of documents, and Monday's raid was quote, "completely inappropriate and unnecessary." Asked whether he would fire Mueller, Trump said "we'll see what happens." Trump can't fire Mueller directly. But he could order Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel's probe, to end it. Or he could fire Rosenstein if he refuses.  --AFP--
