Ramaphosa called on Lesotho to prioritise the constitutional reforms and complete the process in the shortest period of time. SADC Troika Heads of State and Government are meeting in Luanda Angola to consider the political security environment of the SADC region. Constitutional reforms remain a cornerstone towards political stability.  This will constitute the edifice of all other sectorial reforms including security.

With regards to Zimbabwe, Lourenço said he was encouraged by the transitional progress taking place in that country. The summit is expected to conclude on the way forward in relation to conflicts in the region and creating a conducive environment for peace and stability to reign.
