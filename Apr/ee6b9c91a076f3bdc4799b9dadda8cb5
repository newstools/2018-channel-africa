Delays for hundreds of medicines have kept the latest treatments off South African shelves and hampered the fight against cancer, heart and other diseases in a country which also has more people receiving anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) than anywhere else in the world. Besides improving access to life-saving medication, analysts say the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority’s (SAHPRA) proposal could help boost the revenue streams for companies competing in the $3.8 billion-a-year market. “It’s the first time South Africa offers this and we would support a backlog fee, provided it is performance driven,” said Stavros Nicolaou, Senior Executive for Strategic Trade at Aspen Pharmacare. SAHPRA wants to cut the backlog and allow the regulatory assessment of all products in an “achievable but ambitious” timeframe, the authority told Reuters. “As part of this process, SAHPRA is also exploring other potential sources of revenue, including a backlog fee to speed up the registration of products in the current backlog,” said Helen Rees, Chairperson of SAHPRA’s board. Talks with industry on cost implications, procedures and schedule for implementation are on-going, she said. Adcock Ingram said it was keen to discuss SAHPRA’s proposal to expedite reviews of its treatments. “Adcock Ingram currently has more than 250 dossiers awaiting approval,” Spokesperson Kavitha Kalicharan said. The company has waited up to seven years for a regulatory decision on some of its products, she said, and speeding up the process could bolster its prescription division. South Africa’s pharmaceutical market is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.3% over the next decade, reaching R87.5 billion ($7.3 billion) by 2027 from R45.4 billion ($3.7 billion) now, according to BMI Research.
