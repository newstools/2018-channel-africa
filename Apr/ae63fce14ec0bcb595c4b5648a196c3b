Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela resigned in the aftermath of barbaric fan behaviour at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday night following his side's exit in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals at the hands of Free State Stars. "It's interesting to see what's going to happen on the bench and in terms of their team selection," Larsen said. "To be honest, I don't know what to expect. It could work such that the players that wear the jersey want to prove a point. Or it could be that the mood is down and that will give us a chance to maybe capitalise." Chiefs can climb to third with a win, while Arrows are aiming for a crucial three points that will propel them towards the top eight and also confirm their top-flight status for next season. There are only three matches remaining in the 2017/18 campaign. Good news for the hosts is that Danny Phiri and Kudakwashe Mahachi could feature after lengthy injury spells on the sidelines. However, Lehlohonolo Nonyane is a doubt for the clash. The Glamour Boys have announced that Patrick Mabedi will take over the reins on a caretaker basis, and the new man in charge is set to be without Teenage Hadebe and Emmanuel Letlotlo. Kick-off is at 19:30 on Tuesday, April 24. --News24--
