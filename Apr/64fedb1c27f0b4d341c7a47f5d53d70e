The lecture will be held in honour of the late former President, under the theme: “Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a Changing World.” It will focus on promoting equality and creating conditions for bridging divide. The lecture takes place on July 17, a day before the late stateman's birthday. The Nelson Mandela Foundation says it hopes all previous 15 speakers who headlined the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture will be present at this year’s installment.
