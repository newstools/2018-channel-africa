Argentina and Uruguay, who have both won the World Cup twice, decided to launch a joint bid last year and later added Paraguay, who have never won the tournament. The bid is designed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the first World Cup, which took place in Uruguay in 1930. No other bids have been announced for the 2030 tournament. The World Cup will be held in Russia in June-July, while Qatar will stage the event in 2022. Two official bids to host the 2026 event have been submitted to FIFA, a joint bid by Canada, Mexico and the United States and another one from Morocco.
