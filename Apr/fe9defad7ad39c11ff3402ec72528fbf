According to New Zimbabwe.com, the summit is aimed at assessing the situation and evaluating the consolidation of democracy in the region. Quoting a statement by the Angolan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the report said that "the consolidation of democracy in the sub region will also be evaluated, especially in Madagascar, Swaziland, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe". The report said, however, that it did not seem likely that the SADC had any plans to take any stance against the November 2017 ouster of Zimbabwe’s long serving President Robert Mugabe by the military. Mugabe recently made remarks that South Africa could have done “much more’ to save him politically during last year's military takeover. New Zimbabwe.com said that SADC Executive Secretary, Stergomena Lawrence Tax, was in the country last week where she congratulated Emmerson Mnangagwa on being elected leader of the ruling Zanu-PF and becoming the country’s President. "She also praised Zimbabweans for managing the volatile political situation soon after Mugabe was elbowed out of his job," the report said. Meanwhile, a statement by the presidency said on Monday that President Cyril Ramaphosa was scheduled to participate in the SADC Double Troika Summit. The statement said that the summit would also pay attention to Lesotho. --News24--
