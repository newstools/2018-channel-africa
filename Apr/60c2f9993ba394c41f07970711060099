Jackson, who attended Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral on Saturday, was speaking in an interview with the SABC. He says: "It was Winnie who stood up for the peace. The light that would not go out. She was the rock by which we were protected and her resistance in fact led the ground work for those who were in jail to get out and those who weren’t home to get back home." On Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa invited Jackson to a morning Mahatma Ghandi walk with the people of Lenasia, South of Johnannesburg. He did a 12 kilometers walk with the President and around 10 000 community members during the Ghandi Walk.
