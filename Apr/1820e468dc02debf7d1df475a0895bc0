The memorandum was signed and formalised during the World Bank-International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC on Wednesday. The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World bank group each year bring together central bankers, ministers of finance and development, private sector executives, and academics to discuss issues of global concern, including the world economic outlook, poverty eradication, economic development, and aid effectiveness. According to a statement, the mandates and comparative advantages of the two institutions converge around infrastructure development, particularly energy and power, transportation and communication. These key activity areas will provide a framework to foster collaboration in developing programmes, co-financing, and other forms of financial assistance, knowledge and staff exchange. Joachim von Amsberg, AIIB vice-president for policy and strategy, said the memorandum of understanding with the AfDB reflected a strong partnership between two institutions with the same vision to promote sustainable economic development. "It enables more effective cooperation between the two multilateral development banks and allows us to complement each other with our respective capabilities. In particular, it allows AIIB to benefit from AfDBâ€™s rich experience in financing infrastructure projects in Africa." Egypt, Ethiopia, Madagascar, South Africa and Sudan have all joined and been approved to join the AIIB as non-regional members. AfDB vice-president Charles Boamah said: "This partnership will benefit the Bank by leveraging additional resources for the continent, which are critical to the achievement of its High 5 development priorities." He added that it was key for the Bank to cooperate with new development players like AIIB and to join forces in raising the voice of developing and emerging economies in the global policy landscape.
