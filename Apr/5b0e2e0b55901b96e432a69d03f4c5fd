The flyhalf made his return to action for the Cheetahs in the PRO14 against Munster earlier this month. It was his first taste of rugby since he retired after abruptly leaving French club Racing 92 at the end of 2016. Goosen recently signed a deal with French club Montpellier after he was bought out of his contract with Racing 92. He will join Montpellier at the end of June but will keep playing for the Cheetahs in the PRO14 before his departure. According to Netwerk24, Goosen will return to Bloemfontein on Wednesday and will re-join Cheetahs training the following day. He is expected to be included in the Cheetahs’ starting team for Saturday’s clash against the Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth. Kick-off is scheduled for 15:00. --News24--
