The day’s celebrations are dedicated to the founding father of South Africa’s democracy Nelson Mandela and struggle icon Albertina Sisulu. Both would have been 100 years old this year. This year’s Freedom Day celebrations take place under the theme: The year of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela – towards full realisation of our freedom through radical socio-economic transformation. The celebrations will also focus on among others the understanding of where South Africa comes from and celebrating the legacy of struggle icons like Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu as well as identifying untold stories of unsung heroes and heroines. The formal programme will be preceded by a freedom walk to the Dr Molemela stadium and a rendition of poetry and cultural music as well kwaito grooves by local groups. And President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his keynote address around noon.  --SABC--
