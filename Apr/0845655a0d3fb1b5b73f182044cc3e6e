Nzimande briefed Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Transport on his department’s annual performance plans for the 2018/19 year. In his closing remarks Nzimande raised the possibility of a Sanral for the SADC, but did not get into too much detail as not to “excite” the media, as he put it. He said that the department is considering its role and initiatives it can implement in this respect.

Chair of the committee Dikeledi Magadzi said that a Southern African Sanral is “a step in the right direction”. Magadzi said that the Development Bank of Southern Africa and African Bank could get on board for this to work towards the ideals of the African Union. Given that presidents are looking into addressing infrastructure issues in the regions, parliamentarians as the legislators should also make sure that infrastructure development is allowed by the legislation.
