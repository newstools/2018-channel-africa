The R20 ($1.6) an hour minimum wage, which Ramaphosa sees as an important step to tackle labour instability and wage inequality, was approved by the cabinet in November and meant to be introduced on May 1. But dissatisfaction over the minimum wage bill could delay implementation. The new president, who replaced Jacob Zuma as president in February, has staked his reputation on revising a stuttering economy and rooting out corruption associated with Zuma's nine scandal-plagued years in power. The protests are the second major public show of discontent in South Africa within a week. Ramaphosa last week cut short a visit to a Commonwealth summit in Britain a day earlier to travel to the North West province where crowds have been protesting against poor public services. --Reuters--
