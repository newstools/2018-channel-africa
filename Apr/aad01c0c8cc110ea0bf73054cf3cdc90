The outspoken Eymael confirmed to reporters that the cordial relationship between the two had broken down after the swirling rumours that the Belgian was set to replace the embattled Komphela. "Before the rumours surfaced, we were talking (to each other) as coaches, but now we are no longer talking to each other. "These rumours have created rivalry between (the) Chiefs coach and myself. I didn't do anything wrong but perhaps he thinks I did something wrong," Eymael said at a press briefing. "I cannot avoid people to gossip and I also cannot tell the journalists what to write. Until now, I haven't been contacted by either Chiefs or SuperSport United, but in the last few months I was called by maybe four PSL clubs and I said 'no'." Eymael played down the rivalry between the two men insisting that the upcoming Nedbank Cup semi-final between the two sides is purely about the players and not the coaches. "He (Komphela) is not playing, his career is finished in a matter of being a soccer player. And mine is finished since again [I've retired] for a longer time than him," he said. "So we are not playing you know. It's the two teams that are playing, it's not Eymael against Komphela or Komphela against Eymael. It's simply Kaizer Chiefs against Free State Stars." The action gets underway at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday at 20:15. --News24--
