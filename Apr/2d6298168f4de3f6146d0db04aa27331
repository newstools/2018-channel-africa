The National Bureau of Statistics said inflation fell to 3.9% year-on-year in March from 4.1% a month earlier. “Some of the food items that contributed to the decline of the annual headline inflation rate include cassava flour, beans and plantains,” Ephraim Kwesigabo, a Director at the state-run bureau, told journalists in Tanzania’s commercial capital Dar es Salaam. Food has the largest weight in the basket of goods and services used to calculate Tanzania’s inflation. The government said its mid-term target is to contain the inflation rate at 5.0% during 2018/19. --Reuters--
