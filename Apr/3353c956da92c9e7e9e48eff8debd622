Holder revealed his all-time XI on the Lord's Cricket YouTube channel, with the criteria being that he had to have played with or against them, or have been strongly influenced by the players mentioned. The West Indian fast bowler named the usual suspects, which included Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne, both of whom regularly make such lists. Former Proteas all-rounder Kallis slotted at No 6 on Holder's list. "He is one of the greatest all-rounders to play in the game and growing up, it has been a pleasure to watch," the 26-year-old said. Kallis, who retired from international cricket in 2014, played 166 Tests for South Africa scoring 13 289 runs and taking 292 wickets in the process. Holder picked paceman Steyn as his fast bowling option alongside former Australian legend Glenn McGrath and legendary Caribbean bowler, Curtly Ambrose. "I just love his (Steyn) energy, he is electrified and brings a lot to the team. His record is really good all around the world," said Holder. Steyn, with 419 Test wickets to his name, needs just three more scalps to overtake Shaun Pollock (421) to become South Africa's all-time leading wicket-taker in the format. Meanwhile, Holder has played 29 Tests for the Windies to date and has taken 53 wickets with an average of 38.52.
