Hesham Genena was arrested in February following incendiary comments he made in a television interview, in which he claimed that the former Chief-of-Staff Sami Annan was in possession of documents incriminating the country's "leadership". Annan was arrested in January shortly after he announced his intention to challenge President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi in March presidential election. He was accused of incitement against the military and forgery. El-Sissi ran virtually unopposed, winning the election with 97% of the vote. Defence lawyer, Hossam Lotfy, says Tuesday's verdict against Genena will be appealed. Another defence lawyer, Ali Taha, confirmed the verdict in a Facebook posting. --AP--
