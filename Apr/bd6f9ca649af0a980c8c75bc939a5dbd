Israeli television channels broadcasted on Monday Â the clip at the start of their prime-time evening news bulletins - with one host describing it as "disturbing," after it circulated widely on social networks. Its release comes after more than a week of daily protests by Palestinians at the Gaza-Israel border in which 30 Gazans have been shot dead. However, the Israeli military said that the clip might have been filmed months ago. The amateur-style video focuses through a lens or viewfinder on a person in the distance, beyond a wire fence, standing still and alone. A gun fires and the person falls to the ground.

In a tweeted statement, the military said: "With regard to the video of the soldiers at the Gaza Strip border, it was probably an event that occurred a number of months ago. The event will be investigated and examined thoroughly." Reuters was unable to verify the source of the video, or its authenticity.
