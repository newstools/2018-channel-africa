Cutting subsidies to reduce pressure on government spending is one of the countryâ€™s main goals as it pushes forward with reforms to revive an economy that has struggled since a 2011 uprising. It is also a condition of a $12 billion deal Egypt signed with the International Monetary Fund in 2016. Egypt aims to reduce subsidies on fuel to 89.075 billion Egyptian Pounds ($5.05 billion) from 120.926 billion Pounds ($6.8 billion) in the 2018/19 fiscal year, according to the document. It will also reduce electricity subsidies by almost half, bringing them down to 16 billion Egyptian Pounds ($904 million) from 30 billion Pounds ($1.6 billion), the statement said. Last summer, Egypt raised fuel and electricity prices by 50 and 42% respectively, sending inflation shooting up. The country aims to increase food subsidies by 5%, to reach 86.175 billion Pounds ($4.8 billion) from 82.177 billion Pounds ($4.6 billion), according to the same document. Egypt supports about 68.8 million citizens through 20.8 million subsidy cards that grant each citizen 50 Pounds ($2.83) monthly to buy essential goods. The government submitted a 2018/19 budget draft to parliament last month and expects it to be ratified before the start of the new fiscal year.
