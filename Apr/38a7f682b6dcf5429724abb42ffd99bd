The Auditor-General says reports relating to the external audit of VBS Mutual Bank and the conduct of KPMG audit partners are some of the reasons that prompted the decision to withdraw all KPMG audit mandates with immediate effect. On that matters arising from the shareholder transactions involving Nkonki Inc were of “grave concern and pose significant risk on the reputation of his office.” KPMG has responded, saying it hopes that the announcement is a temporary break in the relationship. Just a few day ago, KPMG announced measures to strengthen its governance. This after two of its audit partners, Sipho Malaba and Dumi Tshuma, resigned last week with immediate effect. The two had been facing disciplinary charges related to work done for VBS Mutual Bank. Nkonki Inc’s Chief Executive, Mitesh Patel, resigned last week after it was revealed that his R107 million management buyout’ of the black auditing firm 18 months ago was funded by Gupta family associate, Salim Essa.
