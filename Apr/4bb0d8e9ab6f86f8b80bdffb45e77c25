The appeal from two of the signatories to the landmark 2015 accord came as French President Emmanuel Macron was on a state visit, received with much pomp by US President Donald Trump. Trump Tuesday laid transatlantic divisions bare, pillorying a three-year old agreement designed to curb Iran's nuclear program. The US leader described it as "insane" and "ridiculous," despite European pleas for him not to walk away. Instead, Trump eyed a broader "deal" that would also limit Iran's ballistic missile program and support for militant groups across the Middle East. Macron said the agreement should impose tougher terms on Iran including a settlement in Syria, where it backs President Bashar al Assad. Macron was to address a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday, with more freedom to speak his mind on world issues after his talks with Trump. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday questioned the legitimacy of these demands for a fresh nuclear agreement with Tehran. "Together with a leader of a European country they say: 'We want to decide on an agreement reached by seven parties'. What for? Â Rouhani said in a speech. EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini insisted Wednesday that the current Iran nuclear deal was working and "needs to be preserved". In Moscow, the Kremlin said there can be 'no alternative' to the current deal with Iran. "We believe that no alternative exists so far," President Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that Iran's position on the subject was paramount. Trump said earlier that "they should have made a deal that covered Yemen that covered Syria. No matter where you go in the Middle East, you see the fingerprints of Iran behind problems." --AFP--
