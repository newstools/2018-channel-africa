"We call upon members of the international community to seriously consider the possible consequences of such accusations, threats and especially action against Syria," Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. "Nobody has authorised Western leaders to take on the role of global police, simultaneously investigator, prosecution, judge and executor," she said during a press briefing. "Our position is perfectly clear and defined. We are not seeking escalation." France's Emmanuel Macron said Thursday he had "proof" that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons, and would respond to it "in due course." US President Donald Trump had earlier warned regime-backer Russia that "missiles will be coming" to Syria over the alleged attack in Douma that rescuers said killed 40 people. But on Thursday morning he wrote on Twitter: "Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!" British Prime Minister Theresa May was due to hold an emergency cabinet meeting amid speculation she will support US action against the Syrian regime.  --AFP--
