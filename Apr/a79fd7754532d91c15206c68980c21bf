Coast guard and civil protection authorities rescued 19 of 34 people on board, state news reported. The boat sank off the coast of Oran, a city some 450 kilometers west of the capital Algiers, the official told a TV station, adding that the boat had departed from Morocco. No details on nationalities were provided. Last week, Algeriaâ€™s interior ministry said the North African country was suffering from an influx of illegal migrants from sub-Saharan countries as Europe had made boat departures more difficult from Libya and other countries. --Reuters--
