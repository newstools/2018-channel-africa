"There is a real optimism in the local mining industry. We see it in transactions happening at the moment. Real transactions are taking place on the commercial side. This will have a positive impact and projects that were on hold, could be relooked at," Beech told Fin24.

"The most positive aspect is that both Ramaphosa and Mantashe are committed to getting both the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) and the Mining Charter sorted out."

He explained that for several years following the international economic downturn the local mining sector was in a bad state, along with the industry in the rest of the world.

In South Africa, the situation was made worse by policy and regulatory uncertainty, particularly around the Mining Charter and amendments to the MPRDA. A feeling that changes to the MPRDA were not coming quickly enough contributed significantly to investor concerns. In the case of the MPRDA, several proposed changes have not been passed into law, while some of the changes have been passed into law but have not yet come into force. "The negative consequences of policy and regulatory uncertainty raise the question about why the process to finalise the new Mining Charter and mining legislation amendments stagnated. "Basically, the relationship between the mining industry and former mining minister Mosebenzi Zwane hit a roadblock. There was no communication, and this was not a healthy situation," said Beech.

"Once Zwane was removed, parties started talking to each other. Both Ramaphosa and Mantashe said the Mining Charter will be addressed within three months. There are now consultations in genuine partnership with industry."
