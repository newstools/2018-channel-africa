Zimbabwe said it had sacked 16 000 striking nurses as the new government seeks to keep a lid on labour unrest in the build-up to the first elections since the fall of Robert Mugabe. In a statement to the ZBC News, the HSB said all applicants should have valid practicing certificates. The ministry also said in the interim, all members who are on vacation leave, annual leave and nights off should report for duty with immediate effect. Those who were fired can also apply as new employees, and that they can approach nearest central hospital, provincial hospital and provincial medical health directorate immediately. --ZBC--
