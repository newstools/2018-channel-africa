The ceremony was attended by UN members from across the globe. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says the UN will continue to support all efforts to ending racism in honour of Mama Winnie. “She was an international symbol of resistance, left an indelible mark on the 20th century. In the decades long fight against apartheid, UN stood with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and all those in South Africa who faced unrelenting racism and discrimination. Today as we remember her, the UN reaffirms its commitment to the ideals of equality, justice and equality for all.” UN Special Adviser on Africa, Bience Gawanas from Namibia, says Mama Winnie’s courage inspired her to fight for freedom and peace in her own country. “She inspired me and I followed her call for women not to take the backseat in the struggle for freedom but rather to be at the forefront. So I’m here as Biece Gawanas from Namibia who found courage from Ma’Winnie to fight for freedom, justice and peace in my own country. We’re all here to honour and to celebrate the life and times of Ma’Winnie.”
