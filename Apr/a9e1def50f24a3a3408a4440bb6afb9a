Their stance comes after Lawyer at Richard Spoor attorneys, Thami Malusi, said the company had five working days to respond and tell them whether they will oppose to the application of the lawsuit filed against them by the law firm. A separate and competing application for certification of the same class action has been filed by LHL attorneys. Tiger Brands Spokesperson, Nevashnee Naicker, says the firm is opposing the applications, because, procedurally, the same class action cannot be certified in more than one application. “The court will decide whether it is appropriate for a class action to be certified and if so, the terms of such certification. This is a legal administrative process with timelines for response, and Tiger Brands had to indicate whether it opposes the present process. It has done so, to protect its rights.” The Richard Spoor lawsuit was filed on behalf of 10 class representative applicants, who represent more than 180 people who died from contracting Listeriosis after the health department traced the outbreak to an Enterprise food facility. Malusi said they have chosen 10 representatives as they believe that 10 is a good number considering that a 1 000 people are roughly affected by Listeriosis. When asked about compensation on those affected, Naicker says the company acknowledges that any loss of life is tragic, and that should a link be found between their products and any of the fatalities or illnesses, Tiger Brands will follow processes to assess all valid claims which may be made against it. Tiger Brands says their facilities will only be reopened once all criteria for reopening have been met, in conjunction with the Department of Health. “We do not yet have clarity from government on the criteria which will apply to the re-opening. This, to give all South Africans the assurance of the safety of products produced at Enterprise Foods,” Naicker says.
