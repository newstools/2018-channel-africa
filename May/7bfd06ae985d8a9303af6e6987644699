Hesse State Interior, Minister Peter Beuth, says the 37-year-old Tunisian, identified as Haikel S, was handed over to authorities in his homeland on Wednesday. Beuth said he hoped the deportation would set a precedent and allow Germany to speed up such procedures in the future. The man was arrested in 2017 on suspicion of being a recruiter and smuggler for ISIS and of planning an attack. Tunisia accused him of involvement in the 2015 attack on a Tunis museum and a 2016 attack on the border town of Ben Guerdane. Germany is also trying to deport a 42-year-old Tunisian alleged to have once been a bodyguard for al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. --AP---
