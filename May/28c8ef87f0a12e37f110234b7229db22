Johnson wielded a new putter with precision, notching six birdies for a six-under par 66, his lowest ever score at TPC Sawgrass on a day when Tiger Woods could manage only a 72. Johnson's score was matched by fellow Americans Webb Simpson, Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar and Patrick Cantlay. Swede Alex Noren was also among the leaders, one stroke ahead of a group including South Korean defending champion Kim Si-woo. Not all the big names thrived in the benign conditions. Three-times major champion Jordan Spieth hit three balls into the water on his outward half, the back nine. He posted a three-over 75 that leaves him in danger of missing his fourth consecutive cut in the event. Phil Mickelson can probably start revving up his private jet for an early trip home after scoring 79, having dropped seven shots in a four-hole stretch from the 14th. Johnson has been ranked number one for 64 weeks but has four players nipping at his heels and needs to win to be certain of retaining top spot. Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Spieth and Justin Rose all have a mathematical chance of dislodging him. --Reuters--
