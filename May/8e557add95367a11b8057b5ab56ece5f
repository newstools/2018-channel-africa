Speaking a news conference during the official media day ahead of the Europa League final against Olympique Marseille on May 16, Simeone said it disappointed he will not be able to be no the pitch during next week's final because of a four-match ban, but said he's excited and looking forward to another European final. The Argentinean praised his counterpart from Olympique Marseille, Rudi Garcia, and said the final at Lyon will be a very tough one. He said Griezmann, who has been training hard and competing as normal. Griezmann has been heavily linked with a move to the Nou Camp at the end of the season, with Spanish media reporting that Barca are willing to pay his 100 million euro (87.57 million pounds) release clause.
