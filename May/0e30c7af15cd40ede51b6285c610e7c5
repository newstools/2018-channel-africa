The Mamelodi Sundowns boss suggested that he wanted to vote for Percy Tau, but was unable to due to the fact that coaches are barred from voting for their own players. The final nominees for all categories are set to be announced at the Absa Premiership awards on May 21. "I voted for Itu, because he’s got many clean sheets. If a goalkeeper of a team is goalkeeper of the year, then I think you should know that he was doing a lot of work to make sure that the team doesn’t lose," said Mosimane of his choice to vote for Khune, according to Kick Off. On 21-year-old Ndlovu, Mosimane said: "I also voted for Siphesihle Ndlovu. As I said, I can’t vote for Percy, but when I look at the points-difference between Maritzburg and Sundowns and the number of goals that Percy and ‘Siphe’ scored, I said, ‘Oh, okay, but I have to vote,’ then I voted for the boy. "I think he has done exceptionally well as a youngster and he’s had a fantastic year, but Percy scored – I think – nine goals last year? That’s why he says they are in the same position. So those are the boys who did very well this year." Tau has bagged 11 goals for Sundowns in this season's title-winning Premiership campaign, while Ndlovu has scored five for the Team of Choice.
