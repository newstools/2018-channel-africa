Spokesman Christophe Boulierac told Reuters TV in Geneva that UNICEF had appealed for $88 million to provide assistance in Kasai, but said only about 25% of the funds were received, far from enough to provide adequate medical care. The worst eruption of violence in decades in the region in 2016, with fighting between the army and the Kamuina Nsapu militia, forced an estimated 1.5 million from their homes, leaving without barely anything and leaving them without food. As many as 5 000 people were killed. The guns have fallen silent, but food insecurity remains high as farmers have been unable to plant their crops for the last two seasons due to fighting that has seen their villages and fields pillaged. As hundreds of thousands of civilians are now returning home, hunger and disease are eclipsing guns and machetes as the region's most prolific killers.
