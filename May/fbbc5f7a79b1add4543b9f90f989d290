Wednesday's statement from President Salva Kiir's office also accuses the Trump administration of interfering in South Sudan's affairs ahead of peace talks that resume May 17. The US is the top aid donor to South Sudan, but on Tuesday it said it would review its hundreds of millions of Dollars in assistance if the East African nation's conflict grinds on. The US says it has given over $3.2 billion in humanitarian assistance since the conflict broke out in December 2013. The South Sudan statement also accuses the armed opposition of blocking the path to peace by putting forward what it calls impractical proposals. --AP--
