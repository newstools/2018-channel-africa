But that won’t claw back its 5% losses clocked just last month. The US 10-year Treasury yield’s rise to 3 % last month, driven on fears that possibly even more US Federal Reserve rate hikes are coming sent emerging market assets and currencies into a tailspin. 

However, Emile Du Plessis of Finometrica said that as long as there is adequate policy certainty and improved economic growth, portfolio inflows into South Africa could pick up speed. Emerging market currencies, including the rand, have been under pressure in the past month from a strong dollar bolstered by the Fed decision to raise rates in March and its apparent disposition to raise them at least three more times this year. But the rand is not likely to see deeper sell-offs like it has in previous years, when it was considered part of the “fragile five” economies that included Turkey, Brazil, India and Indonesia. Indeed, the 1.7% loss so far this year in the rand is overshadowed by Turkey’s lira and the Argentine peso, which both have lost more than a tenth of their value since the start of 2018, topping the list of 20 emerging markets’ weakest currencies tracked by Reuters for this period. “I no longer see South Africa the same as Turkey or Argentina,” said Christopher Shiells, emerging markets analyst at Informa Global Markets. “Don’t get me wrong, South Africa still has structural issues such as a current account deficit that relies on foreign portfolio flows to fund, and this has driven rand weakness,” he said. Still, South Africa’s current account gap has narrowed considerably to 2.9% of gross domestic product from a deficit of 6.9% five years ago. Annabel Bishop, Chief Economist at Investec, added that rate differentials between emerging markets and developed countries still remain attractive and so currencies could see further strength this year. --Reuters--
