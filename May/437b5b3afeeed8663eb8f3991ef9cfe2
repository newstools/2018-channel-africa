"More bodies have been recovered raising the death toll to 20," Kibunjah said, updating an earlier toll of 11. The Kenyan Red Cross estimates that up to 500 families were affected by the disaster, which occurred some 150 kilometres northwest of Nairobi. Weeks of torrential rains in Kenya have led to flooding and mudslides and the latest deaths take to 152 the death toll countrywide.
