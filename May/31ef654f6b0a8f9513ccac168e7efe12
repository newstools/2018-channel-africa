Five people thought to be banana farmers were killed in the raid late on Wednesday and several others were captured, says Moalim Ahmed Nur, a traditional elder in the village. A Somali intelligence official says the forces targeted a key hideout and co-ordination centre for the Somalia-based al-Shabaab. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. The US Africa Command has not commented on the raid. --AP--
