The West African sovereign sold $1 billion each of the 10-year notes maturing in 2029 and a 30-year with 2049 maturity at 7.625% and 8.625%, respectively. It set guidance for the May 2029 bond at 7.75% to 7.875% while the May 2049 was in the 8.75% to 8.875% range. The notes were first marketed in the low 8% area yield and low 9% mark. Total books passed $5.5 billion, evenly split between the two tranches, lead advisers said. “It’s a marked success for Accra because they got a low yield and a bigger size,” a sovereign debt market watcher told Reuters. “The pricing revision may have aided the deal and left investors unhappy.” It was Ghana’s sixth sale since a 2007 debut. Lead advisers for the sale were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered. Ghana is rated B3/B-/B The government plans to use some of the proceeds to refinance debt and up to $750 million as revenue for its 2018 budget. Ghana, which exports cocoa, gold and oil, is in its final year of a $918 million IMF credit deal to narrow fiscal deficit, inflation and public debt which hit 69% of gross domestic product in December. The Thursday sale by Ghana followed similar big transactions by continental peers Angola, Kenya and Nigeria. --Reuters--
