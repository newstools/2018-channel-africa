WHO Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced the development in a Twitter post on Friday. Two cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the latest outbreak in a remote north-western part of DRC. The country's health minister on Thursday announced the first death since the outbreak was declared early this week, though the haemorrhagic fever blamed for the death has not been confirmed as Ebola. Nine other suspected cases were announced on Thursday. There is no specific treatment for Ebola. A new experimental vaccine has been shown to be highly effective, though quantities are currently limited. --AP--
