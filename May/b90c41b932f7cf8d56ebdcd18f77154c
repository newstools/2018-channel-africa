The then 20-year-old had to contend with real shots, from real bullets, in the aftermath of his World Cup nightmare in Spain when Hungary beat his country 10-1. The humiliation left its mark, even for a country with little World Cup tradition, and Guevara Mora was ridiculed, abused and even attacked when he returned to Central America after his country's first-round elimination. Guevara Mora, now 56, recalled those dramatic moments in a tearful interview with Reuters. Although infamous in the World Cup, Guevara Mora at his peak was a sprightly keeper that saved many goals for the Central American nation during matches with soccer heavyweights like Argentina in 1982. Decades on, the country has reportedly softened its criticism of Guevara Mora. He had gone on to play professionally in Spain, the United States and Guatemala, and is now a youth coach at a sports centre near the capital San Salvador. His focus now is on helping prevent the 8 000 or so youngsters who fall under his care from joining local gangs. He has not forgotten that fateful day in Alicante but he is nevertheless thankful for the opportunity to play on football's greatest stage. --Reuters--
