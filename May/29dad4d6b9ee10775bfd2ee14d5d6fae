Fatou Bensouda told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday that there has been "significant progress" in investigating crimes committed not only in 2011 but more recently, including sending an ICC team to Libya in March for the first time since June 2012. But she said, "even though my office is making important progress, significant challenges remain." The Security Council referred Libya to the ICC in February 2011 during Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's bloody crackdown against anti-government protesters. The uprising against Gaddafi's 42-year rule quickly escalated into a civil war, and ended in October 2011 with Gaddafi's capture and death. --AP--
