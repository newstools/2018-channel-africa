The Wasps flyhalf, regarded as one of the most talented English players of his generation, has not played for England since 2015. His stop-start international career has been interrupted by injuries, while his occasionally colourful off-field lifestyle has not endeared him to several England coaches. But having previously failed to persuade Jones of his merits, Cipriani was selected in the Australian's 34-man squad for next month's three-Test series against the Springboks. England's 34-man squad announced on Thursday for a three-Test tour of South Africa in June: Backs Fullbacks/wings: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps), Nathan Earle (Saracens), Jonny May (Leicester) Denny Solomona (Sale) Inside backs: Danny Cipriani (Wasps), Owen Farrell (Saracens, capt), George Ford (Leicester), Alex Lozowski (Saracens), Cameron Redpath (Sale), Dan Robson (Wasps), Henry Slade (Exeter), Ben Spencer (Saracens), Ben Te'o (Worcester), Ben Youngs (Leicester) Forwards Back five: Tom Curry (Sale), Ben Earl(Saracens), Jonny Hill (Exeter), Nick Isiekwe (Saracens), Maro Itoje (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Brad Shields (Hurricanes/Wasps), Sam Simmonds (Exeter), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Jack Willis (Wasps), Mark Wilson (Newcastle) Frontrow: Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter), Ellis Genge (Leicester), Jamie George (Saracens), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), Harry Williams (Exeter) Fixtures (all 17:05 kick-off) June 9: South Africa v England, 1st Test, Johannesburg June 16: South Africa v England, 2nd Test, Bloemfontein June 23: South Africa v England, 3rd Test, Cape Town
