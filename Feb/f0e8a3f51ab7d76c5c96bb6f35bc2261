The report, titled: The State of the World's Human Rights, covers 159 countries, including 11 in Southern Africa and delivers the most comprehensive analysis of the state of human rights in the world today. Meanwhile, the report, published on Thursday, said there is a "deepening human rights crisis" in West and Central Africa in 2017. It highlights measures governments have taken to silence protests in Togo, Guinea Ethiopia and Kenya, using force and arbitrary arrests.
