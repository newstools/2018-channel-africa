It was a sharp departure from previous UN reports that documented crimes but not perpetrators. Oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from neighbouring Sudan in 2011 but slid into civil war in December 2013. More than 4 million people, a third of the population, have been uprooted by violence. The investigators from the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan said their findings are based on interviews with hundreds of witnesses, satellite imagery and nearly 60 000 documents dating to the outbreak of the war. Their report, released on Friday, makes the case for "individual command responsibility for widespread or systematic attacks on civilians" by senior military officers, including eight lieutenant generals, and by three state governors. A government spokesperson said they were willing to hold people to account for any crimes. So far, there have been very few prosecutions of South Sudanese military or government officials for crimes against civilians. The UN report details what it calls "appalling instances of cruelty against civilians who have had their eyes gouged out, their throats slit, or been castrated."Â 

It said such violence occurred during five major battles between government troops and rebels in 2016 and 2017. The report contains testimony from a mother who witnessed her son forced to rape his grandmother while his family was held hostage and an 85-year-old woman who said she was gang-raped before watching the execution of her husband and son. --Reuters--
