The 46 police were confined to barracks in Juba on Saturday after a preliminary investigation showed that the Ghanaians were "engaging in sexual activity with women" living at a UN site to protect civilians in Wau, UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. "The information received indicates that some members of the formed police unit allegedly engaged in transactional sex," he added. The UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan has a "zero tolerance, no excuses, and no second changes approach to sexual exploitation and abuse," he said. Ghana is co-operating with the UN to carry out a full investigation of the complaint received on February 8, the spokesperson added. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has vowed to toughen the UN response to allegations of misconduct against the blue helmets whose mission is to protect vulnerable civilians in conflict zones. The United Nations has 7 000 troops and 900 police in its UNMISS mission. About 200 000 South Sudanese are sheltering at UN sites protected by UNMISS peacekeepers. --AFP--
