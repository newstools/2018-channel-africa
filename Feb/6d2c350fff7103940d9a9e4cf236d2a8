The 36-year-old, who beat Andre Agassi's record as the oldest-ever No 1 en route to winning the Rotterdam Open title last week, will now look to stretch his lead over Nadal before the start of the clay court season. "It's unbelievable to be number one again after all these (six) years -- this is one of the best weeks of my life," 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer said after beating Grigor Dimitrov in Sunday's final. Bulgarian Dimitrov's run to the final took him up one place to fourth above Alexander Zverev, while South Africa's Kevin Anderson broke into the top 10 for the first time after winning the New York Open.
