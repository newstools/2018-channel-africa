Among discarded military fatigues, boots and trash, a charred corpse lay inside the smouldering remnants of a hut inside the seized outpost. Congolese authorities accuse the ADF of a series of attacks around the town of Beni between 2014 and 2016 that killed more than 800 people; many of them hacked to death with machetes during the night. The rebels are also blamed for an attack on a United Nations base in December that killed 15 peacekeepers and five Congolese soldiers. Although ADF is just one of many groups across the vast, mineral-rich nation that are responsible for a deadly spike in attacks, Congolese officers say the operations are necessary and point to one particular disfigured body discovered among the scattered remnants of the ADF base as evidence of their progress. They say the man was Muhammad Kayira, one of the ADF's senior operations commanders.  --Reuters--
