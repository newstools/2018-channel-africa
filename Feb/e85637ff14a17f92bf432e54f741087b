Profit increased by 29.4% $4.2 billion for the year, thanks partly to one-off tax savings of $2.09 billion euros resulting from reforms pushed through by US President Donald Trump in December. By comparison, the German group's 2016 profits had been dragged down by a decline in the BT share price and in the pound sterling following the UK's vote to leave the European Union. Full-year revenues for 2017 rose 2.5% to $92 billion, Deutsche Telekom said. Investments meanwhile reached a record $15 billion as the company pumped funds into laying 40 000 kilometers of new fibre-optic cables in 2017 in Germany.
