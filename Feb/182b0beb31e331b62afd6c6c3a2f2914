Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa and South African Transport Minister, Joe Maswanganyi, have unveiled a $400 million revitalisation project between Transnet and the National Railways of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Wednesday. The rail infrastructure was one of the first projects that Mnangagwa pleaded for investment, following his inauguration. The first link between Bulawayo and Harare was put up in 1902 and over the yearâ€™s links to Zambia, Beira in Mozambique, Franscistown in Botswana, and Vryburg and Beitbridge in South Africa were built. The railway was first electrified in 1983 .This infrastructure was intended to buoy Zimbabwe's economy - driven by agriculture and mining to optimise exports, as well passenger commuting More than 100 years on Transnet . But two decades of economic and political sanctions have taken their toll on Zimbabwe only a third of its trains are in service, and even those are in a shockingly unsafe state.

Now Mnangagwa wants to awaken the sleeping giant for $400 million. --SABC--
