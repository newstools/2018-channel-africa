He also announced an entry visa exemption for Tunisian citizens. The president is on his first state visit to Tunis, during which eight bilateral co-operation agreements were signed. The Equatorial Guinean President hailed his visit to Tunisia as "historic and successful," saying such a "South-South co-operation will only strengthen the weight of our continent in the world." He said during a joint press conference with his Tunisian counterpart Beji Caid Essebsi that Equatorial Guinea will be able to benefit greatly from Tunisian experience in the social and economic fields. Essebsi expressed his gratitude for Equatorial Guinea's decision to open its embassy in Tunisia and the visa exemption, saying Tunisia's relations with Equatorial Guinea should be strengthened. Diplomatic relations between Tunisia and Equatorial Guinea date back to 1972. However, the economic links between them are limited. --Xinhua--
