Guido Burgstaller gave the visitors an early lead from a great strike after 11 minutes, the Austrian international flicked the ball over defender Panagiotis Restos before finishing in the bottom corner past Bayer goalkeeper Bern Leno. Leverkusen's half worsened as midfielder Dominik Kohr was given his marching orders after 38 minutes, following two yellow cards within six minutes. A Nabil Bentaleb penalty in the 89th minute secured all three points for the visiting side, after Breel Embolo had been brought down in the box by young Greek defender Restos.
The win moves Schalke into third place, level on points with second placed Borussia Dortmund who play Augsburg at home on Monday. The loss means Leverkusen may drop down to sixth, hampering their hopes of a top four finish,Â  if Leipzig secures any points against bottom side Cologne later on Sunday.
