Not for one minute did he imagine that those two syllables would become internationally synonymous with football greatness. “My father had named me Edson after Thomas Edison, the great inventor. And I was really proud of it! I didn’t want anything to do with Pele,” he chuckled. However, he found a way of channelling this rage to devastating effect on the football pitch and, before too long, he had become one of the most recognisable footballers on the planet. Several decades down the line, and with three World Cup winner’s medals under his belt, O Rei would appear to have made peace with his nickname. “It’s short, it sticks in people’s minds easily,” he conceded, as he looked back over his personal achievements in football. He may have lost a yard of pace since his heyday, but Pele’s company remains as warm and engaging as ever. He spoke to us about his early days and the challenges he faced in the national team, his most memorable goals, Brazil’s current superstar, Neymar, and what lies in store for A Seleção at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™. FIFA.com: At 77 years of age, your name is still synonymous with the FIFA World Cup. Can you sum up what this tournament has meant to you over the years? Pele: You’re absolutely right, I’ve got so many World Cup stories to tell! We never had it all our own way in those tournaments, but we always came out on top. 1958 was a dream: I was still a kid, and nobody thought we could go all the way. They used to question Vicente Feola, asking him how he expected to win the World Cup in Sweden with a 17-year-old in the team. But we did it! Then in 1962, when Brazil were in good shape, I picked up an injury, but we still managed to win the tournament. In England, I broke my meniscus and we fell short. But I played every game in 1970. It completed a perfect cycle for me: I started and finished as a champion. --fifa--
