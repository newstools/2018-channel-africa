Habana has not featured for the Boks since they were stunned by Italy in November 2016. He was unavailable for most of 2017 with a serious knee injury, but he confirmed towards the end of last year that he did know where he stood with then-coach Allister Coetzee. With Coetzee now sacked, the Springboks have a new man in charge in Rassie Erasmus. While he was walking the red carpet in Monaco at the Laureus World Sports Awards on Tuesday night, Sport24 stopped Habana to ask him about his international future. "I don't know ... I might have to chat to Rassie about that," Habana said. The main aim now, though, for the 34-year-old is to get back playing for his French club Toulon. "I'm trying to get back on the go. I've been injured for a while now and I've been training for a few months and I'm looking forward to getting back on the park as soon as possible," he said. "I haven't made a decision about my international career." Habana and his wife, Janine, are expecting the birth of a baby boy in three weeks. "I've got quite a few things coming up," Habana said, nodding his head towards Janine. "I'm going to be 35 in June so I've got quite a few decisions to make. "On a personal level it's been a great run and, of course, the life of Bryan Habana is not going to stop after rugby." He is still undecided, but the idea of never playing for the Boks again is definitely something that Habana has thought about. "We have a little one on the way, so I might have to start thinking about settling down," he said. "But I havenâ€™t made a 100% clear decision as yet." --Afp--
