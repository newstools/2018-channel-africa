Daniela Ionita with the UN refugee agency says the deaths occurred in Kiziba refugee camp and the nearby town of Kibuye in western Rwanda. The UN is urging Rwandan authorities to investigate. Rwandan police had confirmed only five dead in a statement on Friday that said they had acted after "demonstrators armed with stones, sticks and metal projectiles assaulted and wounded seven police officers." The demonstrations demanding better living conditions or relocation began on Tuesday in Kiziba camp, which hosts over 17 000 Congolese refugees. Underfunding forced the UN World Food Program to cut food rations by 25% in January. --AP--
