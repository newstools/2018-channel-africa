The church-backed protests in the Democratic Republic of Congo come after months of tension sparked by Kabila's prolonged rule and long-delayed elections in the vast and chronically unstable country. In the capital Kinshasa, one man was killed and two people seriously injured as police opened fire on demonstrators. "Since 07:00 we have received three injured people from the Catholic march. Two were seriously injured and one died from a bullet wound in the chest," said Francois Kajingulu, a senior doctor at the St Joseph de Limete hospital in central Kinshasa. An AFP journalist in the north-eastern city of Kisangani said at least two people suffered bullet injuries as police fired on marchers. Three priests were arrested as they led a march in the Saint Pierre de Wagenia district in the east of the city. Officers took them away in a police vehicle, the journalist said. Hundreds began marching after mass at Kisangani cathedral but were dispersed by security forces who fired bullets and tear gas. The demonstrators fled back into the cathedral singing the national anthem, "Debout Congolais" (Arise Congolese). The nationwide protests were called by the Lay Co-ordination Committee, an organisation close to the church and an influential social and spiritual movement. But authorities banned the demonstrations. Kabila was due to stand down from office in December 2016, ending his second elected term, but he has controversially stayed on under laws enabling him to retain power until his successor is elected. In January he accused the church of interfering in Congolese politics. Previous protests on New Year's Eve and January 21 saw a total of 15 people killed by security forces, according to tolls given by organisers and the United Nations. The government said just two people died in the unrest.
