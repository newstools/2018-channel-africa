Federica Mogherini was speaking to journalists at a donor conference of about 50 countries including the United States, Japan and Norway in Brussels. She promised a doubling of EU funding to 100 Million Euros for the G5 Sahel force, made up of troops from Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. Fears that violence in the arid zone could fuel already high levels of migration towards Europe and become a springboard for attacks on the West have made military and development aid there a priority for European nations and Washington. France, which has more than 4000 troops in the region, hopes to reach at least 300 Million Euros in military aid on Friday to overcome financing problems for the force that was first proposed in 2014, while militants have scored military victories in West Africa. So far, the United States has pledged 60 Million Euros to support it. Another 100 Million Euros has been pledged by Saudi Arabia, 30 million from the United Arab Emirates and 40 million on a bilateral basis by EU member states, separate from the EU. The G5 Sahel operation, whose command base is in central Mali, is to swell to 5,000 personnel from seven battalions and will also engage in humanitarian and development work.  --Reuters--
