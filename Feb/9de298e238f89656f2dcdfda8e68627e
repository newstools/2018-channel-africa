The bodies according to parents, a resident and a local government official were recovered on Wednesday. It's believed 13 students may still be missing after it was reported that 91 people were unaccounted for after the attack. Yobe state authorities say some of the girls rescued from the militants are now with the Nigerian army troops. President Muhammadu Buhari has meanwhile directed three members of his cabinet to investigate the attack on the all-girl college. The families of dozens of girls missing for several days after Boko Haram attack on their school in northeast Nigeria on Thursday faced an anxious wait for their return after confirmation some had been rescued. Police said on Wednesday that 111 girls from the state-run boarding school in Dapchi, Yobe state, were unaccounted for following an attack by the jihadists on Monday night. The disappearance sparked fears of a repeat of the 2014 mass kidnapping of more than 200 girls from a similar school in Chibok, in neighbouring Borno state.
