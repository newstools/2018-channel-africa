A veteran of 168 Test matches, Waugh is in Monaco as an Academy member of the Laureus World Sports Awards, which take place on Tuesday night. The 52-year-old, like the rest of the cricketing community, was shocked to hear of Morkel's decision to retire from all formats of international cricket at the end of the four-match Test series against the Aussies. "That’s good news for a lot of batsmen around the world," Waugh said. "He’s been terrorising batsmen for a long time. "The thing I like about Morne is that he’s a fantastic bowler who is very respectful of the game. He’s a very humble person. "I didn’t play against him, but I just like the way he plays the game. He just tears in every ball and gives it everything. "He's one of the most underrated players in the world." Waugh had voiced his opinion that Australia boasted the best attack in the world, but he does think news of Morkel's retirement will work in South Africa's favour. "South Africa will play with more emotion, I think, and they’ll want to win for him," said Waugh. "He’s been such a good team man. I’m sure our batsmen wish he could have retired one series earlier." Now 33, Morkel has played in 83 Test matches and is South Africa's fifth-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 294. --news24--
