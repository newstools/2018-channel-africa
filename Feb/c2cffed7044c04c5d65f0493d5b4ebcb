Diluted headline earning per share (HEPS) rose 55% to 73.4 cents for the six months to the end of December compared with 47.4 cents in the previous reporting period. This was in line with what the company had flagged to the market. HEPS is the main profit gauge in South Africa which strips out certain one-off items. RCL said a decline in feed input costs and higher chicken prices following lower levels of unprotected imports and the impact of avian influenza on supply boosted trading conditions in the poultry market. “Headline earnings for the period ended December 2017 increased 56.9% to R644.7 million ($55.8 million) largely due to an improved result in the chicken business unit,” the firm said in a statement. However, RCL said a recovery in production volumes in its sugar business as drought conditions abated was offset by lower industry prices due to the impact of higher import volumes during the period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the unit fell 27% to R210.7 million ($18.2 million) compared to the previous reporting period. RCL declared an interim dividend of 15 cents per share, up 50% from the year-ago period. --Reuters--
