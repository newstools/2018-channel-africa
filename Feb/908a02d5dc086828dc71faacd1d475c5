Data from the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Agency (UNICEF) indicates that at least 3.9 million people are food insecure up from 3.4 million people IN 2017. Kenya declared the drought a national disaster in February 2017. Across the horn of Africa region, 22.9 million people are affected by the drought. The parched dry earth, the livestock carcasses and the weak cries of malnourished children tell the story of a country staring at a humanitarian crisis. "We can see some counties that are now getting to the tipping point and are getting into a full blown drought situation and what we are saying is that we need to respond before things become worse than they already are," said Secretary General of Kenya Red Cross Society, Abbas Gullet. Climate change has forced families to migrate even further in search of food and pastures for their livestock. Education is taking a back seat. It is however not the first time Kenya is faced with a food security challenge. "This will see as long as their needs and as long as we have not addressed issues of food insecurity in our country," said Gullet. Weather predictions indicate that the upcoming short rains will be insufficient, making the Red Cross appeal desperate and urgent if the East African is to avert hunger related deaths.
