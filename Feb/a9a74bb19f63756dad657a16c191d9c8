The benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.07% or 234.37 points to close at 21.736.44 and the broader Topix index was down 0.88% or 15.44 points at 1.746.17. "While the market appears to have hit the near-term bottom, investor sentiment has yet to fully recover following recent volatile trade," Hikaru Sato, senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities, told AFP. In early trading, the Nikkei index took its lead from declines on Wall Street after minutes from the US central bank's last meeting solidified expectations of interest rate hikes ahead. "The content of the minutes was no surprise but the US stocks' negative reaction to it dragged the Tokyo market down," said Toshihiko Matsuno at the investor information division of SMBC Nikko Securities. "US stocks swings indicate it may take some more time for investor sentiment to calm down" from volatility earlier in February, he told AFP. US stocks were in positive territory most of the session on Wednesday, but began falling about 40 minutes after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of last month's policy meeting. US central bankers said the recent tax cuts could spur the economy more than expected in the near term, meaning further interest rate hikes would likely be needed, according to the minutes. In individual stock trade, Honda dropped 1.03% and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial lost 0.58%. NTT climbed 2.54% after the telecom carrier announced a share buyback. Office equipment producer Ricoh plunged 3.92% after a news report said the firm was considering booking up to $932 million in impairment losses.
