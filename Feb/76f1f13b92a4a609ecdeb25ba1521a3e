Francisco Madeira, the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, said the incident is under investigation by both the government of Somalia and AU mission in Somalia (AMISOM). "I present my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this senseless attack, which was aimed at creating terror among the population," Madeira said in a statement issued in Mogadishu. "AMISOM strongly condemns this attack and reiterates its resolve to continue working side by side with Somali National Security Forces to free Somalia from violent extremism and terrorism," Madeira added. Two vehicles loaded with explosives detonated near intelligence headquarters and Villa Somalia and Al-Shabaab elements started firing at innocent civilians. The first explosion went off at around 6pm local time when a vehicle loaded with explosives hit the newly opened Dorbin hotel near the intelligence headquarters then shortly followed by the second one near Villa Somalia. Madeira commended the bravery and professionalism of the Somali National Security Forces and AMISOM, who succeeded in neutralising five Al-Shabaab elements involved in the attacks. --Xinhua--
