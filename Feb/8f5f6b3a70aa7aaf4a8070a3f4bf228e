The southern African country allocated more than 4 billion Namibian Dollars ($344 million) to some of the more than 300 State-owned companies. Some of those firms racked up combined losses of about 150 million Namibian Dollars a year. Namibia’s economy plunged deeper into recession in the third quarter of 2017 as declines in construction and trade eclipsed growth in manufacturing and mining. “Unfortunately our current economic status cannot allow for things to remain the same,” Public Enterprises Minister, Leon Jooste, said. “All of us need to realise it is no longer business as usual and days of commercial (public enterprises) receiving government subsidies are numbered,” he said. Jooste said the government needed to intervene to increase accountability in state-owned companies. “Although we believe in paying market-related remuneration packages, the total wage bill which stands at about 6.1 billion Namibian Dollars is not sustainable at the current level of performance,” he said.
