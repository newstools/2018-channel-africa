China's railways, highways and airports all experienced the busiest days. Some 11.8 million passengers were estimated for the country's railways on Wednesday, up 7.6% year on year, according to Chinese railway authorities. To cope with the heavy flow, the railway authorities added 1.091 passenger trains nationwide. China's civil aviation administration estimated that over 15.700 flights were made on Wednesday, with Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, one of the country's busiest airports, receiving about 210.000 travelers. Heavy traffic and jams were also reported on highways in many parts of the country. In southwest China, long queues of vehicles, mostly cars and coaches, were seen at toll gates on some sections of the highways linking Chongqing or Chengdu with Shanghai, with the worst congestion extending nearly 60 kilometers. Ferry services, suspended due to heavy fog, resumed on Wednesday morning in Hainan Province, one of China's most popular tourist destinations. Massive stranded vehicles and passengers in its capital city of Haikou are now making their way out of the island.
