The group further argues that these laws are used to justify violence against those with a different sexual orientation in the East African country. Many African countries outlaw homosexuality and those accused of practising it face legal harassment and physical threats from the community. The petition has been challenged by legislator Irungu Kangat who called homosexuality a lifestyle choice. "Well, I am somehow perturbed to see that this case is being supported by the westerners,"Kangata said. "It is a form of western colonisation. They want to demean Africans. They want to demean us Kenyans." It is unclear when the court will rule on the petition.
