Mansour used to buy Swiss chocolate for his daughter but in the past few days it disappeared from the shelves after Algeria's government banned imports of hundreds of products. At the start of this year, authorities banned the import of 851 products including foodstuffs and some raw materials in an effort to address a gaping trade deficit. While browsing the Ardis mall in the capital Algiers with his wife and six-year-old daughter, Mansour said he felt the brunt of the import ban. "I don't find the products that I used to find before. We noticed that the prices of local products increased, compared to the past. I think the reason is the absence of competition," he said. Officials say the restrictions will encourage domestic production, protecting it from foreign competition.      But local firms including drinks producers and potters are complaining, saying shortages of raw materials put their businesses at risk. Ardis, which opened its doors in 2012 and is the largest mall in the country, attracts consumers every day because of the wide range of local and imported consumer goods it stocks. That range has now been reduced, though Walid Allouni, the mall's store manager, played down the change. "This import restriction is a blessing in disguise. I see it that way because it will encourage local and national companies to double their efforts and become more productive," he said. But many local firm managers are worried and feel that the restrictions may only add pressure on them, leading to a possible collapse of their business because of declining stocks of raw materials. Strikes and protests occur in Algeria almost daily, echoing social and economic grievances.  --Reuters--
