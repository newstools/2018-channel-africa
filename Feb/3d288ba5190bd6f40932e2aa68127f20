London's benchmark FTSE 100 index shed 0.5% to 7.243.32 points compared with the close on Wednesday, as traders also digested a series of earnings updates from major companies. In the Eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX 30 shed 0.9% to 12.358.82 points and the Paris CAC 40 lost 0.6% to 5.272.43. Meanwhile Britain's biggest energy supplier Centrica said Thursday it would cut 4000 jobs by 2020 after announcing a 17% drop in profits due to a loss of customers and poor performance in North America.

"We expected the new programme to involve reduction in like-for-like headcount of around 4000 by 2020," the company, which employs around 33 000 people, said in a statement.
