The protest was a part of a nationwide movement launched by middle school and high school students following last week's deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Student protesters walked all the way from Capitol Hill to the White House, chanting slogans including, "This is what democracy looks like," and, "Are we next?" They are protesting against the government's inaction in controlling guns amid frequent school shootings in the country. "Parkland, Sandy Hook, Columbine it's just inaction. Our blood is on your hands by inaction," said a student protester. The shooting that killed 17 students and staff members at Parkland High School on Valentine's Day is the latest in a long list of United States mass killings that have occurred in recent years. In 2012 a deranged gunman entered the Sandy Hook elementary school and murdered 26 people there, including many children. The gunman killed his mother before he started the school shooting and in the end he shot himself as well. In 1999, two senior high students gunned down their classmates and teachers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, killing 13 and wounding 20. US official data shows that in 2018 alone, 18 school shootings took place across the country, with eight of them causing deaths. This amounts to a school shooting roughly once every 70 hours. Students say they are afraid that they will be the next victims.
