Videos of shoppers pushing and shoving as they tried to grab tubs of the chocolate spread, a breakfast favourite in France, went viral on the internet last month. The DGCCRF fraud watchdog said its investigation showed Intermarche had illegally sold the spread at below-cost, adding that it had transferred the case to prosecutors. The supermarket could face a maximum fine of $461 000 for the aggressive pricing strategy, used to draw shoppers in to spend on other products. The chain also slapped the 70 % discount on Pampers nappies, Carte Noire cafe and Perrier sparkling water. "Our agents have concluded that Intermarche did not respect measures in place concerning selling at a loss, which is a criminal offence," a DGCCRF spokesperson told AFP. Intermarche has apologised after its three-day promotion prompted shoving and even full-blown fights in several stores over the Nutella. The price of a 950-gram jar went down from $5.60 to $1.73 overnight, sparking scenes that one worker likened to "an orgy". Videos of the shopping frenzy were shared thousands of times on social media, with comedian Anthony Joubert racking up a million plays on a song featuring the lyrics, "A euro for Nutella, I'd kill a mother or father for that." The chain did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Ferrero, the Italian company that makes Nutella, said the discount decision was taken "unilaterally" by Intermarche and risked creating "confusion and disappointment" for consumers.  --AFP--
