Augsburg came into the match on the back of consecutive defeats and found themselves playing catch up after just 16 minutes when Marco Reus tapped in a loose ball in front of the goal. Augsburg came back stronger in the second half, putting Dortmund under real pressure. They were eventually rewarded in the 73rd minute when Kevin Danso put away the equaliser off a rebound from Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki. The hosts had a few chances to seal the win late in the piece but Augsburg held their nerve and kept up the pressure to take the draw and a valuable point.
